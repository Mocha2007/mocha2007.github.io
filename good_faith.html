<p>
	This is supposedly a rant on why you should assume good faith,
	but midway it goes on a tangent into bitching about <i>that one certain group of people</i>.
</p>
<p>
	Have you ever been misunderstood, or have you ever misspoken, and it seemed everyone around you jumped to conclusions?
	You may be the victim of <i>assumed malice</i>.
	Have you ever misunderstood someone, and jumped to conclusions?
	You may be the perpetrator of <i>assumed malice</i>.
	If you understand your mistake, and resolve to never make it again, you're alright.
	Everyone's been misunderstood, everyone's misunderstood.
	We <i>all</i> do it - but being a mumpsimus helps no one, and hurts everyone.
</p>
<p>
	Even if it seems obvious to you the person is acting in bad faith, it may not be so to others.
	If no one else sees malice, you should ask yourself why <i>you</i> do.
	"Common Sense" is only a phrase to describe things which are obvious to us but not to others.
</p>
<p>
	Even if everyone else sees malice, isn't it possible they misspoke?
	Isn't it possible English is not their first language?
	Isn't it possible they mistyped?
	Isn't it possible they were half-awake and not thinking straight?
	You should consider <i>why</i> you see malice as the only explanation.
	What do <i>you</i> know that everyone else doesn't?
</p>
<p>
	I've had the misfortune of joining some of <i>those</i> types of communities - 
	the ones with nonstop drama, and nothing but negativity.
	It is truly incredibly just how far someone will take assumptions about the malice of others -
	even going as far as turn single words into entire sentences and paragraphs of assumed assumptions on assumed assumptions, 
	none of which even remotely accurately depict what their victims actually say.
</p>
<p>
	It's equally surprising to see the hypocrisy of these people.
	Remember, or learn, for the unaware, it's <i>these</i> types who claim to be inclusive and forward-thinking, but in truth,
	I find, they are the most <i>exclusive</i> and <i>backwards</i> people out there.
	Their so-called inclusivity is merely a front, 'virtue signalling' as it's often called.
	They, consciously or not, have no interest in <i>being</i> virtuous, only <i>appearing</i> virtuous.
	After all, what point is there in being virtuous if you can't brag about it?
	Being a good person is <i>so</i> last century - you just have to make youself <i>appear</i> good!
</p>
<p>
	<i>These</i> types only consider their in-groups - minorities are of no concern to them.
	It's easier to accuse minorities of bigotry than to face your own, after all - marginalized groups are easy to harass.
	But we can't <i>appear</i> to hate minorities! So, we'll just, I don't know, spread 'activism'?
	As long as little browny doesn't invade my <i>safe space</i>, I really couldn't care less.
	They <i>should</i> know all the ins and outs of our <i>inclusivity</i>!
	It doesn't matter if they live in poor communities, and even after struggling to understand English, fail to meet my standards of inclusivity.
	Only <i>inclusive</i> people are allowed in our inclusive community.
	Those brownies should stop being <i>so racist and bigoted</i>!
