<h2>Interests:</h2>
<p>
	You can find a more thorough list of likes in my <a href="recommend.html">recommendations</a> page, 
	but here are my broad interests: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Mathematics</b>:
		<ul>
			<li>Number Theory - Properties of integers - primes, etc.</li>
			<li>Matrices - I've been taking a linear algebra course and have fallen in love. Save me before it's too late...</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Anime - I've been watching more and more often. It's slowly becoming a pasttime. Not sure what genre I like most since I haven't watched much, but dramas tend to be interesting.</li>
	<li>Computer Programming - Honestly, how the hell else am I supposed to do my homework? By hand? Like a fucking pleb?</li>
	<li>Culture Shit:
		<ul>
			<li>Linguistics - Culture in general is interesting, but languages are my favorite part.</li>
			<li>Stories - Like, personal stories. Because I'm creepy af obv. I love the Slice-of-Life genre. To pieces.</li>
			<li>Traditions - Quirks of culture.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Furry shit - ...BOO! Hah, you blinked!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hobbies:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Cartography - see the <a href="namei.html">Namei glossary</a> for numerous maps of my current conworld.</li>
	<li>Conlanging - I also do words...</li>
	<li>Conworlding - ... among other things.</li>
	<li>Image Editing - Particularly, speed-image-editing, 
	where I try to edit an image as quickly as possible. 
	This practice started when I watched streams with friends and wanted to make visual jokes before the joke ran stale. 
	I have since been doing it as a hobby since it is fun, 
	and have developed numerous techniques that allow me to rapidly edit images, 
	without having to sacrifice much in terms of quality. 
	I have slowly developed this personal 'style' and am quite pleased with some of the results.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Okay, really though. What are you?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A faggot (Bi, <i>ish</i>) - it's complicated.</li>
	<li>Questioning - probably something like agender but a label doesn't matter to me enough to find one. Unfortunately there isn't a really offensive transgender slur (YET!) so I will have to make due with self-identifying as a <i>tranny</i>.</li>
	<li>Part human (white) and part subhuman (not-white, hispanic to be exact) - 
		I get to oppress myself, isn't that cool?! 
		I took a genetic test a while ago and also found myself about ~1/7 Native American, as well. 
		This is probably paternal (my father's side is hispanic and poorly-documented), 
		but I have no clue to what ethnic groups I may be related. 
		Personally though, I consider myself Hispanic White. 
	</li>
	<li>Furry Trash, as if cringe could possibly reach such concentration. I own nothing yet though, so maybe I'm redeemable.</li>
	<li>A student - I also work part-time at my college.</li>
	<li>Descriptivist - With regards to grammar, 
		but sometimes prescriptivist in written language, 
		cause come the fuck on man! 
		Have some decency!
		</li>
	<li>Politically:<br/>
		Since recent events <i>*cough cough election cough*</i> I have become less political, 
		but I consider myself to be:
		<ul>
			<li>Unaffiliated/No Party/None/Whatfuck ever</li>
			<li>Center-Left, although nowadays I seem to be closer to center.</li>
			<li>Egalitarian - There are only a small handful of exceptions, eg. I think there should be a drinking age.</li>
			<li>Pacifist - <i>And I murder all who disagree</i>. Seriously though, no exception.</li>
			<li>Pro-Free-Speech/Pro-First-Amendment - <i>Except towards people I disagree with, I mean, fuck those guys, amirite?</i></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Aside from these labels I don't really consider myself anything else, but my views on more specific issues usually align with progressivism. 
	I am far enough left to have been called a commie and far enough right to have been called a fascist. 
	Little do they know, I am a new breed of radical - a <i>comscist</i>! Err... a <i>fascommie</i>? 
	Nah, doesn't work either. Oh well. <i>Degenerate</i> is sufficient.

<h2>REAL Unpopular Opinions (READY YOUR ANUS)</h2>

<b>The results of the 2016 election were unsurprising.</b>

<p>
	I'm not going to argue from a platform or political perspective, but a statistical one. 
	All of the polling data showed that the election was close - nearly as close as the 2000 election. 
	There were <i>numerous</i> known routes where Trump could win - eg. "secret trump voters", the so-called "blue wall", which speaking of which...
</p>

<b>The blue wall was always unstable.</b>

<p>
	Based on polling data from before the election, each blue wall state was the equivalent of rolling one six-sided die... and hoping to not roll a one or two. 
	Now, granted, <i>most</i> of the dice won't be ones... but it'd be more surprising if one or two <i>didn't</i> flip. 
	Keep in mind, the blue wall consisted of up to seven states (depending on who you ask), so we would expect two or three to flip on average (in the actual election, five did). 
	Statistically speaking, the results of the election were <i>higher</i> than the average, but not obscenely so. 
</p>

<b>Dems do <i>not</i> have a free ticket to the 2020 Presidency.</b>

<p>
	The 2020 election will unfold in one of two ways. Either A, 
	they try again for a repeat of the election, run a Clinton-esque candidate, and fail <i>again</i>, even to Trump, or B, 
	they take a step back and realize the only way forward is to run a progressive candidate, &agrave; la Sanders. 
	The Democratic party had the election in the <i>bag</i> and they threw it away cause they were pussyfooting around the progressive platform. 
	The next generation of voters is <i>not</i> going to vote for Clinton people anymore, and this effect will only strengthen come more elections. 
</p>

<b>The Don is neither Hitler nor Saint</b>
<p>
	It's well known that Donald Trump is not of the <i>best</i> moral character, 
	but I feel the media has overplayed how bad of a person he is - to the point of hilarious irony and self-unawareness. 
	There is little point in my arguing this - you have made up your mind long before visiting this website. 
	You either hate him or love him. There seems to be, unfortunately for me, no middle ground. 
</p>
<p>
	I feel, ultimately, Trump will end up rememberd the opposite way of Harding - 
	initially, Harding was well-liked during his term, but after several years as more and more scandals unfolded, his memory became corrupted. 
	Trump, I feel, will be remembered the opposite: hated and plagued by scandal during his term(s), whether legitimate or "fake news", 
	but as the bigger picture becomes visible, I feel people will at least <i>soften</i> their rage. 
</p>

<b>Freedom of Speech, not "Freedom of Only Speech I Like"</b><br/>
Or: <i>How to use Argument for Evil, or yeah, sure, Good too, I Guess</i>
<p>
	You don't have to <i>agree</i> with the left or right, but they have a right to speak their minds. 
	If you are incapable of debating them in a serious, honest discussion, then your position is baseless and weak beyond tatters. 
	Take for example, Neo-Nazis. A lot of people are saying they should be imprisoned for their views alone, 
	but if their position is as ridiculous and despicable as you claim (which, we can likely both agree, it <i>clearly</i> is), 
	then use argument to show the public how ridiculous these people are, instead of making complete <i>asses</i> and <i>dolts</i> out of yourself. 
</p>
<p>
	To be completely, no-sarcasm honest, when I hear people say people with certain positions should be banned from speaking, I read the subtext that you <i>agree</i> with their position. 
	I mean, if you can't even do something as simple as argue against a position, especially one you <i>claim</i> to oppose, 
	then I can only assume you <i>completely and fully agree</i> with said position. 
	Forget even comparing you to other <i>people</i>, this would make you even less articulate than other <i>species of animals</i>, 
	including Gorillas and Chimpanzees, which have been documented to explain their reasoning for feeling certain emotions, using sign language. 
</p>
<p>
	Don't like being subhuman? Tired of injuring yourself jumping from your chromosome count to your IQ? 
	Here, since you seem to be utterly incapable of forming any kind of rational argument, let me help you out with some:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Neo-Naziism is wrong <b>because</b> I believe in equality between all people."</li>
	<li>"Flat Earth Theory is wrong <b>because</b> if the Earth really were accelerating upwards at 1g, then we would reach the impassible speed of light in less than a year."</li>
	<li>"Rigdecai is not otp <b>because</b> unlike with Mordecai, Rigby's interactions with High-Five Ghost are universally positive."</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Now I know this requires you to use your singular, lonely brain cell, but bear with me here. 
	The pattern all of these arguments take is the <i>same</i> - "X is true/false <b>because</b> Y". 
	You state your <b>claim</b> and then support your claim with <b>reasoning</b>. 
	This is called an <b>argument</b>. Learn to use it and stop sounding like a fucking two-year old who mommy didn't buy a new toy for.
