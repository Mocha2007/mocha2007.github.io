	A Mocha is not a thing, but an idea. An interesting idea. An idea so interesting it has gained 
	sentience and learned how to use memes to conquer the world.

<h2>What is this website?</h2>
<p>
	This website is a collection of several things: 
	my conlangs and conworlds, including latest conworld <i><a href="namei.html">Namei</a></i>, collections of information I find useful, and small "what-if?" projects I've worked on. 
	Since my primary fields of interest are mathematics and linguistics, most of the content on this site is either on or inspired by these fields. 
</p>
<p>
	Chances are you stumbled across this site either by trying to find my conlangs or by searching something weirdly specific into google that only small esoteric sites like these, in the backalleys of the internet, would have. 
	Please note that I am not a professional <i>anything</i>, and so information found on this site should be used with a <abbr title="20mL">heaping tablespoon</abbr> of salt. 
	In any case, please enjoy your stay. 
</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>
	You can find a more thorough list of likes in my <a href="recommend.html">recommendations</a> page, 
	but here are my broad interests: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Mathematics</b>:
		<ul>
			<li>Number Theory - Properties of integers - primes, etc.</li>
			<li>Matrices - I've been taking a linear algebra course and have fallen in love. Save me before it's too late...</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Anime - I've been watching more and more often. It's slowly becoming a pastime. Not sure what genre I like most since I haven't watched much, but dramas tend to be interesting.</li>
	<li>Computer Programming - Honestly, how the hell else am I supposed to do my homework? By hand? Like a fucking pleb?</li>
	<li>Culture Shit:
		<ul>
			<li>Linguistics - Culture in general is interesting, but languages are my favorite part.</li>
			<li>Stories - Like, personal stories. Because I'm creepy af obv. I love the Slice-of-Life genre. To pieces.</li>
			<li>Traditions - Quirks of culture.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Furry shit - ...BOO! Hah, you blinked!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<!--
<details>
	<summary>OwO</summary>
	What's this???
</details>
-->
<ul>
	<li>Being alone</li>
	<li>Being awkward</li>
	<li>Forgetting what I just said</li>
	<li>Forgetting what I just said</li>
	<li>Forgetting what I just said</li>
	<li>Forgetting what I was just about to do</li>
	<li>Accidentally writing lists that are out of order</li>
	<li>Indecision on only the least important choices</li>
	<li>Listening to the same vine on loop for 16 hours</li>
	<li>Never finishing projects</li>
	<li>Overanalyzing everything</li>
	<li>Regretting a social interaction that happened a decade ago that literally nobody else remembers</li>
</ul>

Whoops wrong list lol

<ul>
	<li>Cartography - see the <a href="namei.html">Namei glossary</a> for numerous maps of my current conworld.</li>
	<li>Conlanging - I also do words...</li>
	<li>Conworlding - ... among other things.</li>
	<li>Image Editing - Particularly, speed-image-editing, 
	where I try to edit an image as quickly as possible. 
	This practice started when I watched streams with friends and wanted to make visual jokes before the joke ran stale. 
	I have since been doing it as a hobby since it is fun, 
	and have developed many techniques that allow me to rapidly edit images, 
	without having to sacrifice much in terms of quality. 
	I have slowly developed this personal 'style' and am quite pleased with some of the results.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Okay, really though. What are you?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A faggot (Bi, <i>ish</i>) - it's complicated.</li>
	<li>Questioning - probably something like agender but a label doesn't matter to me enough to find one. Unfortunately there isn't a really offensive transgender slur (YET!) so I will have to make do with self-identifying as a <i>tranny</i>.</li>
	<li>Part human (white) and part subhuman (not-white, hispanic to be exact) - 
		I get to oppress myself, isn't that cool?!
	</li>
	<li>Furry Trash, as if cringe could possibly reach such concentration. I own nothing yet though, so maybe I'm redeemable.</li>
	<li>A student - I also work part-time at my college.</li>
	<li>Descriptivist - With regards to grammar, 
		but sometimes prescriptivist in written language, 
		cause come the fuck on man! 
		Have some decency!
	</li>
	<li>Politically:<br/>
		Since recent events <i>*cough cough election cough*</i> I have become less political, 
		but I consider myself to be:
		<ul>
			<li>Unaffiliated/No Party/None/Whatfuck ever</li>
			<li>Center-Left, although nowadays I seem to be closer to center.</li>
			<li>Egalitarian/Equalist - There are only a small handful of exceptions, eg. I think there should be a drinking age.</li>
			<li>Pacifist - <i>And I murder all who disagree</i>. Seriously though, no exception.</li>
			<li>Pro-Free-Speech/Pro-First-Amendment - Except towards people I disagree with, <i>I mean, fuck those guys, amirite?</i></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	And before you say "well sounds like you're a...", no, no I'm not. 
	I don't care how you define political groups, I only identify as what I've already listed. 
	As for my views on more specific issues, they usually align with progressivism.

<h2>Mocha Described in Quotes</h2>
<h3>With Commentary</h3>
<p>
	In general I hate quotes, but for the purpose of making a quick list describing myself, there's hardly a more effective way. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Brevity is the soul of wit.
		<ul>
			<li>This is the <i>sole</i> philosophical quote I ever quote verbatim - it's already perfect. In addition, it is true in <i>multiple ways</i>:</li>
			<li>No argument is more effective than one straight and to the point.</li>
			<li>A proof relying on fewer assumptions is better than one relying on many.</li>
			<li>A lot of people write long-winded, vacouous, and vapid blog posts. Their blogs would be so much more amazing if they'd just get to the damn point already.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A witty saying proves nothing.
		<ul>
			<li>Partly why I refrain from direct quotations.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The only thing I know, is that I know nothing.
		<ul>
			<li>The more you know about a subject, the more you learn you don't know.</li>
			<li>If you think you know even most of what there is to know about something, you're wrong.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Any fool can know. The point is to understand.
		<ul>
			<li>
				This in particular rings true to me as one who tutors in math. 
				People focus too much on memorizing formulae instead of understanding <i>why</i> they work. 
				The greatest irony is that you don't actually <i>need</i> to memorize a single formula in math, as long as you <i>truly understand why</i> the formulae work. 
				There are numerous formulae I don't memorize, because I can just resynthesize them on-the-fly since I know <i>why</i> they work. 
				The ones I <i>have</i> memorized I only know because I've resynthesized them enough times it's second nature. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To be wronged is nothing, unless you continue to remember it.
		<ul>
			<li>Grudges are dumb. Don't hurt youself with their stupidity.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If someone corrects you, and you feel offended, then you have an ego problem.
		<ul>
			<li>Seriously, they're doing you a huge favor. If you don't listen now you'll only make a fool of yourself later.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Everyone suffers one of two pains: the pain of discipline, or the pain of regret.
		<ul>
			<li>
				Suffer a little now or a lot later. 
				Although, for me, I have suffered <i>both</i> pains! 
				Clearly, I am not living my life most efficiently. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mocha on the Issues</h2>

<p>
	I am far enough left to have been called a commie and far enough right to have been called a fascist. 
	Little do they know, I am a new breed of radical - a <i>comscist</i>! Err... a <i>fascommie</i>? 
	Nah, doesn't work either. Oh well. <i>Degenerate</i> is sufficient.
</p>
<p>
	I update this table as I think of things to add, so yeah, this is not comprehensive or anyshit:
