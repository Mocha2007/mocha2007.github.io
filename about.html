	A Mocha is not a thing, but an idea. An interesting idea. An idea so interesting it has gained 
	sentience and learned how to use memes to conquer the world.

<h3 id="What_this_Website_is">What this Website is</h3>
<p>
	This website is a collection of several things: 
	my conlangs and conworlds, including latest conworld <i><a href="namei.html">Namei</a></i>, collections of information I find useful, and small "what-if?" projects I've worked on. 
	Since my primary fields of interest are mathematics and linguistics, most of the content on this site is either on or inspired by these fields. 
</p>
<p>
	Chances are you stumbled across this site either by trying to find my conlangs or by searching something weirdly specific into google that only small esoteric sites like these, in the backalleys of the internet, would have. 
	Please note that I am not a professional <i>anything</i>, and so information found on this site should be used with a <abbr title="20mL">heaping tablespoon</abbr> of salt. 
	In any case, please enjoy your stay. 
</p>

<h3 id="Other_Info">Other Info about this Site:</h3>

	In Firefox, simply go to View -> Page Style and select which style you want. 
	In IE and Opera, simply go to View -> Style. 
	Currently, this site (aside from index.html, recommend.html, and search.html) offers these styles:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Light - the default theme you likely seem here</li>
	<li>Dark - the default theme with background colors and foreground colors swapped, resulting in a dark appearance</li>
	<li>Blend - a 'best of both worlds' between the dark and index themes</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Please enjoy this new<!--09 Jul 2017--> update! I have also added a printer-friendly style to these same pages too!
</p>

<h2 id="Interests">Interests</h2>
<p>
	You can find a more thorough list of likes in my <a href="recommend.html">recommendations</a> page, 
	but here are my broad interests: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Mathematics</b>:
		<ul>
			<li>Number Theory - Properties of integers - primes, etc.</li>
			<li>Matrices - I've been taking a linear algebra course and have fallen in love. Save me before it's too late...</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Anime - I've been watching more and more often. It's slowly becoming a pastime. Not sure what genre I like most since I haven't watched much, but dramas tend to be interesting.</li>
	<li>Computer Programming - Honestly, how the hell else am I supposed to do my homework? By hand? Like a fucking pleb? The current edition of Mocha offers 3 options: Python 3, Javascript, and Haskell. Note: requires constant connection to <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/'>SO</a> to run.</li>
	<li>Culture Shit:
		<ul>
			<li>Linguistics - Culture in general is interesting, but languages are my favorite part.</li>
			<li>Stories - Like, personal stories. Because I'm creepy af obv. I love the Slice-of-Life genre. To pieces.</li>
			<li>Traditions - Quirks of culture.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Being alone</li>
	<li>Being awkward</li>
	<li>Forgetting what I just said</li>
	<li>Forgetting what I just said</li>
	<li>Forgetting what I just said</li>
	<li>Forgetting what I was just about to do</li>
	<li>Accidentally writing lists that are out of order</li>
	<li>Indecision on only the least important choices</li>
	<li>Listening to the same vine on loop for 16 hours</li>
	<li>Never finishing projects</li>
	<li>Overanalyzing everything</li>
	<li>Regretting a social interaction that happened a decade ago that literally nobody else remembers</li>
</ul>

Whoops wrong list lol

<ul>
	<li>Cartography - see the <a href="namei.html">Namei glossary</a> for numerous maps of my current conworld.</li>
	<li>Conlanging - I also do words...</li>
	<li>Conworlding - ... among other things.</li>
	<li>Image Editing - Particularly, speed-image-editing, 
	where I try to edit an image as quickly as possible. 
	This practice started when I watched streams with friends and wanted to make visual jokes before the joke ran stale. 
	I have since been doing it as a hobby since it is fun, 
	and have developed many techniques that allow me to rapidly edit images, 
	without having to sacrifice much in terms of quality. 
	I have slowly developed this personal 'style' and am quite pleased with some of the results.</li>
	<li>Programming - You're looking at it. You can check out my github profile for other programs.</li>

<h2 id="Quotes">Mocha Described in Quotes</h2>
<h3>With Commentary</h3>
<p>
	In general I hate quotes, but for the purpose of making a quick list describing myself, there's hardly a more effective way. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Brevity is the soul of wit.
		<ul>
			<li>This is the <i>sole</i> philosophical quote I ever quote verbatim - it's already perfect. In addition, it is true in <i>multiple ways</i>:</li>
			<li>No argument is more effective than one straight and to the point.</li>
			<li>A proof relying on fewer assumptions is better than one relying on many.</li>
			<li>A lot of people write long-winded, vacouous, and vapid blog posts. Their blogs would be so much more amazing if they'd just get to the damn point already.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A witty saying proves nothing.
		<ul>
			<li>Partly why I refrain from direct quotations.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The only thing I know, is that I know nothing.
		<ul>
			<li>The more you know about a subject, the more you learn you don't know.</li>
			<li>If you think you know even most of what there is to know about something, you're wrong.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Any fool can know. The point is to understand.
		<ul>
			<li>
				This in particular rings true to me as one who tutors in math. 
				People focus too much on memorizing formulae instead of understanding <i>why</i> they work. 
				The greatest irony is that you don't actually <i>need</i> to memorize a single formula in math, as long as you <i>truly understand why</i> the formulae work. 
				There are numerous formulae I don't memorize, because I can just resynthesize them on-the-fly since I know <i>why</i> they work. 
				The ones I <i>have</i> memorized I only know because I've resynthesized them enough times it's second nature. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To be wronged is nothing, unless you continue to remember it.
		<ul>
			<li>Grudges are dumb. Don't hurt youself with their stupidity.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If someone corrects you, and you feel offended, then you have an ego problem.
		<ul>
			<li>Seriously, they're doing you a huge favor. If you don't listen now you'll only make a fool of yourself later.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Everyone suffers one of two pains: the pain of discipline, or the pain of regret.
		<ul>
			<li>
				Suffer a little now or a lot later. 
				Although, for me, I have suffered <i>both</i> pains! 
				Clearly, I am not living my life most efficiently. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
