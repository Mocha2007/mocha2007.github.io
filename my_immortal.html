			XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
			Hi my name is Ebony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that’s how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid 
			tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don’t know who she is get da hell out of here!).
			I’m not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he’s a major fucking hottie. 
			I’m a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. 
			I have pale white skin. 
			I’m also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I’m in the seventh year (I’m seventeen). 
			I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly black. 
			I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. 
			For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. 
			I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. 
			I was walking outside Hogwarts. 
			It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. 
			A lot of preps stared at me. 
			I put up my middle finger at them.
			“Hey Ebony!” shouted a voice. 
			I looked up. It was…. Draco Malfoy!
			“What’s up Draco?” I asked.
			“Nothing.” he said shyly.
			But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.

			The next day I woke up in my bedroom. 
			It was snowing and raining again. 
			I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had. 
			My coffin was black ebony and inside it was hot pink velvet with black lace on the ends. 
			I got out of my coffin and took of my giant MCR t-shirt which I used for pajamas. 
			Instead, I put on a black leather dress, a pentagram necklace, combat boots and black fishnets on. 
			I put on four pairs of earrings in my pierced ears, and put my hair in a kind of messy bun.
			My friend, Willow (AN: Raven dis is u!) woke up then and grinned at me. 
			She flipped her long waist-length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her forest-green eyes. 
			She put on her Marilyn Manson t-shirt with a black mini, fishnets and pointy high-heeled boots. 
			We put on our makeup (black lipstick white foundation and black eyeliner.)
			“OMFG, I saw you talking to Draco Malfoy yesterday!” she said excitedly.
			“Yeah? So?” I said, blushing.
			“Do you like Draco?” she asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into the Great Hall.
			“No I so fucking don’t!” I shouted.
			“Yeah right!” she exclaimed. Just then, Draco walked up to me.
			“Hi.” he said.
			“Hi.” I replied flirtily.
			“Guess what.” he said.
			“What?” I asked.
			“Well, Good Charlotte are having a concert in Hogsmeade.” he told me.
			“Oh. My. Fucking. God!” I screamed. I love GC. They are my favorite band, besides MCR.
			“Well…. do you want to go with me?” he asked.
			I gasped.
