<p>
	My Philosophy.
</p>
<h2 id="Meaning_of_Life">What is the Purpose of Life?</h2>
<p>
	To have a net positive impact on humanity, whether through significant acts such as the improvement of human knowledge or the creation of great works of art, or through simpler acts such as teaching, volunteering, charity, or goodwill. 
</p>
<h2 id="Morality">What is Moral?</h2>
<span class="desc">What is Good? What is Bad?</span>
<p>
	If you wouldn't mind an action be done to you, or if the action would never reasonably affect you, the action is not immoral. 
</p>

<h2 id="Existence_of...">Is/Are there...</h2>

<h3 id="Afterlife">... an Afterlife?</h3>
<p>
	No, so you better make the best of yours. 
</p>

<h3 id="Aliens">... Aliens?</h3>
<p>
	Yes. 
	Although many of the values of the coefficients in the drake equation are disputed, even the most conservative values indicate there are numerous aliens, even intelligent ones. 
</p>

<h3 id="Free_Will">... Free Will?</h3>
<p>
	I believe that the future is predetermined, that you are in control of your actions, and are responsible for your actions. 
	Apparently this causes a lot of people discomfort, but I honestly can't see why. 
	Interpret that however you will. 
</p>

<h3 id="God">... a God?</h3>
<p>
	Outside of semantic games, no. 
</p>

<h3 id="Soul">... a Soul?</h3>
<p>
	Outside of semantic games, no. 
</p>

<h2 id="Attempt">Is it Worse to Fail then to Try?</h2>
<p>
	It is better to try than fail. 
	If you try and succeed, well, you succeed. 
	If you try and fail, you have, hopefully, learned from your mistakes. 
</p>

<h2 id="Before_Universe">What came before the Universe?</h2>
<p>
	What comes before zero on a ruler? 
	Nothing can come 'before' a beginning, because if something could, then it wouldn't be the beginning! 
	The big bang is the earliest known event; although it appears to be the earliest event <i>period</i>, that may very well not be the case. 
	Until evidence of earlier events is demonstrated, I consider the big bang to be the absolute beginning of the universe. 
</p>

<h2 id="Nobody_Knows">Is a 'wrong' act okay if nobody ever knows about it?</h2>
<!-- From http://operationmeditation.com/discover/65-deep-philosophical-questions/ -->
<p>
	But <i>you</i> would know - so no. 
</p>

<h2 id="Religion_and_Science">Are Religion and Science Compatible?</h2>
<p>
	Outside of semantic games, no. 
</p>

<h2 id="Time">What is Time?</h2>
<p>
	I believe time is physically no different than the spatial dimensions, but that we perceive time in a way for us to relate it to the other dimensions. 
	I consider time to the perceptive equivalent of an x-axis (independent variable), and the spatial dimensions of length, width, and height to be the equivalent of a y-dimension (dependent variables). 
</p>
<p>
	This is much like how a 1-dimensional cellular automaton can either be represented as a 1-dimensional video, where each successive frame is determined by the last, 
	or a 2-dimensional image, where each successive row is determined by the last. 
	Expanding this analogy to reality, we are experiencing a 4-dimensional static image, where each successive arbitrarily small t-dimension is determined by the last, 
	however, like the automaton, we can also express this 4-dimensional static image as a 3-dimensional video.
