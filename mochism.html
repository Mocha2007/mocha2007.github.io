<p>
	My Philosophy.
</p>

<h2 id="Axioms">Axioms</h2>
<p>
	These are the basic axioms of my philosophy.
	They are ordered such that values higher on the list take precedence over lower ones.
</p>

<h3 id="Must">What Must Be</h3>
<ol>
	<li>People have the right to have neither themselves nor their property be physically contacted without consent, or used in a way against their consent.</li>
	<li>People's freedom to perform any action should never be impeded.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Note: property is and may only be any physical item - IP including patents, slogans, etc. are <i>free game</i>.
</p>

<h3 id="Punishment">What Must Be Punished</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Any violation of a person's rights as outlined above not conflicting with the following.</li>
	<li>Lying to others with the intent to manipulate them into performing an action contrary to that if they knew the truth is to be punished.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Should">What Should Be</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Knowledge should be pursued.</li>
	<li>Amicability should be pursued.</li>
	<li>The improvement of humanity should be pursued.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Government">Extra Rules for Governments</h3>
<ul>
	<li>No discrimination will be made on the basis of inalienable personal identity (eg. Religion, Gender, etc. - note that this does not include alienable identity, including voluntary association).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Positions">Positions</h2>

<h3 id="Five_Freedoms">Five Freedoms</h3>
<p>
	The five freedoms of <b>press, petition, religion, speech, and assembly</b> are logically derivable by Axioms 2.
	As none of the freedoms require breaking Axiom 1, these rights are implicit.
</p>

<h3 id="Ten_Commandments">Ten Commandments</h3>
<ol>
	<li><b class="against"></b>, as it conflicts with Axiom 2.</li>
	<li><b class="against"></b>, as it conflicts with Axiom 2.</li>
	<li><b class="against"></b>, as it conflicts with Axiom 2.</li>
	<li><b class="against"></b>, as it conflicts with Axiom 2.</li>
	<li><b class="against"></b>, as it conflicts with Axiom 2.</li>
	<li><b class="against"></b>, as it conflicts with Axiom 2, although if done so against their consent you <i>will</i> be punished.</li>
	<li><b class="against"></b>, as it conflicts with Axiom 2.</li>
	<li><b class="for"></b>, as it logically follows Axiom 1.</li>
	<li><b class="against"></b>, as it conflicts with Axiom 2, although you <i>will</i> be punished.</li>
	<li><b class="against"></b>, as it conflicts with Axiom 2.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Laws">Laws/Proposals and how they Align</h3>
<p>
	If there are possible caveats, I try to mention them.
	If it should be illegal, I explain why.
	With the exception of special notes, I keep the "legal"s blank.
	For the love of all that is holy, <b>do not read this section unless you intend to read everything</b>.
	If you complain about something in this section without having read the entire thing, you give me the right to call you <i>whatever obscenities I so desire</i>.

			Mr. Good Samaritan comes across a CP production website by accident (mistyped a link, misclicked, whatever), and reports it to the police.
			The police arrest Mr. Kiddy Diddler - so far so good, right?
			But here's where the problem lies:
			Mr. Good Samaritan may have <b>inadvertently downloaded</b> CP onto their machine.
			If CP Possession is made blanket-illegal, Mr. Good Samaritan gets booked for possession.
			Did Mr. Good Samaritan do anything wrong?
			In my opinion, <b>no</b>.
			Thus, to me, possession of CP <i>in and of itself</i> should not <i>always</i> be a crime.
			There are also numerous other examples one can come up with, but I think this is the most agreeable.

<!--
<h2 id="Meaning_of_Life">What is the Purpose of Life?</h2>
<p>
	To have a net positive impact on humanity, whether through significant acts such as the improvement of human knowledge or the creation of great works of art, or through simpler acts such as teaching, volunteering, charity, or goodwill. 
</p>
<h2 id="Morality">What is Moral?</h2>
<span class="desc">What is Good? What is Bad?</span>
<p>
	If you wouldn't mind an action be done to you, or if the action would never reasonably affect you, the action is not immoral. 
</p>

<h2 id="Existence_of...">Is/Are there...</h2>

<h3 id="Afterlife">... an Afterlife?</h3>
<p>
	No, so you better make the best of your life. 
</p>

<h3 id="Aliens">... Aliens?</h3>
<p>
	Yes. 
	Although many of the values of the coefficients in the drake equation are disputed, even the most conservative values indicate there are numerous aliens, even intelligent ones. 
	It should be noted, however, that I do not believe aliens have actually <i>visited</i> Earth. 
</p>

<h3 id="Cryptids">... Cryptids?</h3>
<p>
	Outside of semantic games, no. 
</p>

<h3 id="Free_Will">... Free Will?</h3>
<p>
	I believe that the future is predetermined, that you are in control of your actions, and are responsible for your actions. 
	Apparently this causes a lot of people discomfort, but I honestly can't see why. 
	Interpret that however you will. 
</p>

<h3 id="God">... a God?</h3>
<p>
	Outside of semantic games, no. 
</p>

<h3 id="Magic">... Magic?</h3>
<p>
	Outside of semantic games, no. 
</p>

<h3 id="Soul">... a Soul?</h3>
<p>
	Outside of semantic games, no. 
</p>

<h2 id="Attempt">Is it Worse to Fail than to Try?</h2>
<p>
	It is better to try than fail. 
	If you try and succeed, well, you succeed. 
	If you try and fail, you have, hopefully, learned from your mistakes. 
</p>

<h2 id="Before_Universe">What came before the Universe?</h2>
<p>
	What comes before zero on a ruler? 
	Nothing can come 'before' a beginning, because if something could, then it wouldn't be the beginning! 
	The big bang is the earliest known event; although it appears to be the earliest event <i>period</i>, that may very well not be the case. 
	Until evidence of earlier events is demonstrated, I consider the big bang to be the absolute beginning of the universe. 
</p>

<h2 id="Nobody_Knows">Is a 'wrong' act okay if nobody ever knows about it?</h2>
<!-- From https://operationmeditation.com/discover/65-deep-philosophical-questions/
<p>
	But <i>you</i> would know - so no. 
</p>

<h2 id="Religion_and_Science">Are Religion and Science Compatible?</h2>
<p>
	Outside of semantic games, no. 
</p>

<h2 id="Time">What is Time?</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Ca110-interaction2.png" height=400 alt="Rule 110 Automaton">
<div class="desc">The Rule 110 cellular automaton. Each row affects the next.</div>
<p>
	I believe time is physically no different than the spatial dimensions, but that we perceive time in a way for us to relate it to the other dimensions. 
	I consider time to the perceptive equivalent of an x-axis (independent variable), and the spatial dimensions of length, width, and height to be the equivalent of a y-dimension (dependent variables). 
</p>
<p>
	This is much like how a 1-dimensional cellular automaton can either be represented as a 1-dimensional video, where each successive frame is determined by the last, 
	or a 2-dimensional image, where each successive row is determined by the last. 
	Expanding this analogy to reality, we are experiencing a 4-dimensional static image, where each successive arbitrarily small t-dimension is determined by the last, 
	however, like the automaton, we can also express this 4-dimensional static image as a 3-dimensional video.
