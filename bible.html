	The Bible, "translated" and "edited" from Latin, by Mocha.
</p>
<h2 id="Genesis">Genesis</h2>
<h3 id="Genesis_Chapter_1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>
	1 At the beginning, Sky Daddy created the Earth and the sky,
	2 but the Earth was undefined, hollow, dark, so his Spirit flew over the water, 
	3 and said, "Light!" and there was light. 
	4 He distinguished the light from dark. 
	5 He called the light "Day", and the dark "Night", and, keep in mind, this is just day one, and there's already fukken photons whizzing about and shit. 
	6 Day two he said, "Sky!",
	7 and then the sky existed. 
	8 He called the sky "Heaven", which is Nevaeh backwards. 
	9 Then he said, "Land!", and then land existed, 
	10 and he called the dry part "Earth", and the wet part "Ocean", and was really enjoying this circlejerk.
	11 Then he said, "Grass, seed, and fruit!",
	12 and yadda, yadda, yadda, you get the idea. 
	13 So what was that, day three I think? 
	14 But the plants started dying cause he forgot to give them light, so he said, "Celestial Objects!",
	15 and then the plants were like, "About fukken time mate.". 
	16 It's important, though, that he made two special lights, one for day, and the other for night. And the stars can also be there, too. 
	17 The combination of all these lovely photon-givers provided the chloroplasts with the much needed light Sky Daddy forgot to provide them day three. 
	18 He was still circlejerking 
	19 day four, by the way. 
	20 Then he said, "Varmints!", 
	21 and they was.
	22 He said, "Hey guys can you just fuck and make lots of babies so I don't have to just copy-paste like a billion times? Thanks.".
	23 Such was life in the fifth day. 
	24 All the aminals fucked merrily. 
	25 Then Sky Daddy made hoomans 
	26 in his likeness, and gave them free rein over the rest of the critters. 
	27 The circlejerk kept going. 
	28 He told them to fuck eachother and to fuck over anything else, 
	29 and that he left plenty of food and water. 
	30 He left the shitty plants to the rest of the animals to eat, 
	31 and was all, "Yup, I did good.". 
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_Chapter_2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>
	1 Finally, Sky Daddy was done with all that creating shit, 
	2 and just chilled the weekend. 
	3 He really liked this idea, and decided to make a custom of it. 
	4 But he wondered if he could've done this differently. 
	5 He realized he should've made the sun before the plants, 
	6 but he wondered if, perhaps, he should've just made plants not need the sun. 
	7 Maybe, also, he should've made guys from the ground instead of from nothing. That would've made more sense. 
	8 "Yeah,", he thought, "and then I could've made plants right after... meh, next time, 
	9 and then I could, like, make good and evil trees!
	10 And I could have a zen-ass river in the middle, 
	11 and give the river a cool-ass name like 'Pison', or 'Havilah',
	12 and they can go gold panning in it!
	13 Actually, maybe 'Gihon'?
	14 Fuck it, I'll just make a miniature version in the Middle East.". 
	15 And the miniature version was put there. 
	16 "Anyways, about those trees, 
	17 I'm gonna have one that grants its consumer knowledge, but also death, 
	18 and then tell this guy Adam to not eat it... lol.", said Sky Daddy. 
	19 But just then, he had a kinky-ass idea. 
	20 He went to Adam, 
	21 gave him a roofie, and amputated one of his ribs, 
	22 poofing it into a chick. 
	23 And Adam said, "Dude I have the weirdest boner right now.". 
	24 And they fucked, 
	25 merrily.

	1 Here is a list of the dudes who came with Jacob: 
	2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, 
	3 Issachar, Zebulun, Ben, 
	4 Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, 
	5 and like seventy other guys.

<h3 id="Mark_Chapter_1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>
	1 This is the the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
	2 Just like the prophet Isaiah said, Sky Daddy sent his messenger to the world to show the way, 
	3 and, as a voice in the desert, yelled, "Prepare the way for the lord, and make his path clear!". 
	4 Meanwhile, this guy John was in the desert baptizing, and announced baptisms to forgive sins. 
	5 So lots in Jerusalem, and even Judaea, came to him, and were all baptized in the Jordan, and confessed their sins, which were, of course, as numerous as could be. 
	6 John was wearing a chic camelskin cloak with belt, eating ants on a log, and generally acting gay. 
	7 He announced, "Someone even cooler than me's coming, so cool I'm not even allowed to kiss his ass.  
	8 Where I baptized with water, he'll baptize with his Spirit.".
	9 Soon after, Jesus came from Nazareth so John could baptize him in the Jordan. His was a long one, and John had to cut him off after he started on about a threesome with two other guys. 
	10 When he finally came up from the water, the sky cleared, and the Spirit shot into him like some fukken laser, and he started spazzing out and shit. 
	11 A voice behind the clouds whispered, "Dis gun be gud", 
	12 and the Spirit bamfed him into the desert. 
	13 He was there for a whole fukken month, and the sinmaster tempted him with wild animals, but sexy angels distracted him, so he was good. 
	14 Meanwhile, they got John for possession, again, and when Jesus came back he announced the kingdom of god, 
	15 and said, "It's time.". 
	16 As he took a leisurely stroll by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and bro Andy, casting a net into the sea, as they were fishermen, 
	17 and he said, "Come with me, and I'll make you fishers of men.", to which they replied, "Dude, you're fucking stoned.", 
	18 but, since they were totally bored, decided to go along with it anyways. 
	19 On the way, he saw Zebedee's kids Jim and John, who were also fucking with nets. 
	20 He called them, and they also came, since fishing is gay. 
	21 <!--When the Sabbath came, -->They went to the synagogue in Capernaum and preached. 
	22 Everyone thought his preaching was super cool, 
	23 except this one asswipe who said, 
	24 "Fuck you!", 
	25 and Jesus said, "No, fuck you!", 
	26 and he totally exorcised this wicked-ass ghoul thing outta him. 
	27 Everyone clapped. 
	28 OP Jesus went unnerfed, and the exploit became renowned throughout the community. 
	29 After they left the synagogue, they went to Simon and Andy's place, with Jim and John. 
	30 Simon's mother-in-law had a really bad cold, so they told Jesus, 
	31 and Jesus bamfed the cold away. 
	32 In the evening everyone brought their sick and possessed to Jesus, 
	33 and they watched all night as 
	34 he told the demon after demon to fuck off, and they all fucked off. 
	35 In the morning, Jesus reminisced on the good times. 
	36 Simon and the gang went to look for him, 
	37 and when they found him they said, 
	38 "Dude let's do this the next town over!", 
	39 and they did. 
	40 There was even this sick-ass leper dude who 
	41 Jesus 
	42 cured, 
	43 and he went about his merry way. 
	44 The gang all went, "Woah", 
	45 and everyone around was like, "Woah". 
</p>
<h3 id="Mark_Chapter_2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>
	1 When he came back to Capernaum, word spread fast. 
	2 It was so fucking crowded you couldn't breathe, but, always the people pleaser, he preached anyways. 
	3 They brought him to this dude with palsy, 
	4 who was lying in bed, 
	5 and he forgave his sins. 
	6 But there were these guys who were all like, 
	7 "But only Sky Daddy can forgive!", 
	8 and Jesus was like, "First off, buddy, 
	9 it's like waaaay easier to just forgive sins than to actually, you know, cure him or someshit, 
	10 and second, I AM Sky Daddy, and I accept your dare!", 
	11 and then Jesus cured the palsy guy. 
	12 He started running around all gay-like, cause I guess that's something guys with palsy do or someshit. 
	13 Later he preached by the sea, 
	14 and as he strolled by, he saw Alphaeus' kid Levi pissing around, and said, "Follow me, dude.", and he did. 
	15 Later, as Jesus was eating dinner in his house, a lotta guys also sat with him and his disciples. 
	16 When some guys saw him eat with all these fags, they said, "Why you eating with these fags?". 
	17 So Jesus said, "I'm helping them not sin.".
