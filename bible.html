<h2 id="Genesis">Genesis</h2>

This book would take place c. 4000 BCE. 

<h3 id="Genesis_1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>
	1 At the beginning, Sky Daddy created the Earth and the sky,
	2 but the Earth was crappy, so he flew overhead, 
	3 and said, "Light!" and there was light. 
	4 He distinguished the light from dark. 
	5 He called the light "Day", and the dark "Night", and decided to call this thing a "day" cause he needed to be all organized and shit. 
	6 Day two he said, "Sky!",
	7 and then the sky existed. 
	8 He called the sky "Heaven", which is Nevaeh backwards. 
	<span class="add">- This was surprisingly difficult to accomplish, and this activity took up the entire second day. </span>
	<span class="mov">13 Day three, </span>
	9 he said, "Land!", and then land existed, 
	10 and he called the dry part "Earth", and the wet part "Ocean", and was really enjoying this selfjerk.
	11 Then he said, "Grass, seed, and fruit!",
	12 and yadda, yadda, yadda, you get the idea. 
	<span class="mov">19 But day four, </span>
	14 the plants started dying cause he forgot to give them light, so he said, "Celestial Objects!",
	15 and then the plants were like, "About fukken time mate.". 
	16 It's important to note, though, that he made two special lights: one for day, and one for night. And the stars can also be there, too. 
	17 The combination of all these lovely photon-givers provided the chloroplasts with the much needed light Sky Daddy forgot to provide them day three. 
	<span class="del">18 </span>
	<span class="mov">23 Day five, </span>
	20 he said, "Varmints!", 
	21 and they was.
	22 He said, "Hey guys can you just fuck and make a ton of babies so I don't have to copy-paste like a billion times? Thanks.".
	<span class="del">24 </span>
	<span class="add">- Day six, </span>
	25 Sky Daddy made a hooman 
	<span class="mov">2:7 from the fuckin dirt, breathed life into him, </span>
	<span class="add">- and called him Adam. </span>
	26 He made him in his own likeness, and gave him free rein over the rest of the critters. 
	<span class="del">27 </span>
	28 He told him to fuck each other and to fuck over anything else, 
	29 and that he left plenty of food, water, and newspapers. 
	<span class="mov">2:8 Then he made a fukken garden called Eden, and put him in it, </span>
	<span class="mov">2:15 and told him he was the gardener. </span>
	<span class="mov">2:9 It had both a good and evil tree in it, </span>
	<span class="mov">2:10 and a river </span>
	<span class="mov">2:13 or two. </span>
	<span class="del">30 </span>
	31 After all that, he pat himself on the back. 
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>
	1 Sky Daddy was finally done with all that creating bullshit, 
	2 and decided to just chill the weekend. 
	3 He really liked this idea, and decided to make a custom of it. 
	<span class="del">4-6 </span>
	<span class="del">11-12 </span>
	<span class="del">14 </span>
	16 Then Sky Daddy said, "Anyways, about those trees, 
	17 One that grants its consumer knowledge, but also death, 
	18 so don't eat it or you'll totally burn in Hell.", said Sky Daddy, to which Adam replied, "What the hell is Hell?". 
	19 Just then, Sky Daddy, realizing he was never going to trick Adam, 
	20 went to him, 
	21 gave him a roofie, and amputated one of his ribs, 
	22 poofing it into a chick 
	<span class="add">- called Eve. </span>
	23 Adam said, "Dude I have the weirdest boner right now.", 
	<span class="del">24 </span>
	25 and they totally fucked. 
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p>
	1 Sky Daddy delegated the job of deception to a talking snake, and said to Eve, "I'll fucking kill you if you eat that fruit." 
	2 To which Eve replied, 
	3 "Ok.".
	4 But the snake said, "Dude, you don't seriously believe that, do you? 
	5 I mean, come on, instadeath? I bet it's a stat boost he's trying to hoard.". 
	6 So she was all, "Yeah, you're right!", and nommed the everloving fuck outta that fruit, but her husband was more skeptical. 
	7 Then they both realized they were still naked, and promptly clothed themselves. 
	8 Then Sky Daddy came down all pissed, 
	9 and said, "Once I find you fuckers, I'm gonna make 9/11 look like it was done by fukken cripples!", 
	10 to which they replied, "We're prudes now, Sky Daddy, and you can't sexualize us anymore!" 
	11 So he said, "Oh I am soooo sending you two to eternal torture in a plane of fire!", 
	12 and Adam was like, "Yo I didn't do it, it was all her, send her to the fire plane!" 
	13 So Sky Daddy yelled to Eve, "What the everloving fuck dude?!", to which she replied, "Dude I was only doing what your snake buddy told me!". 
	14 So Sky Daddy cursed the snake to be a really shit creature. 
	15 "Since you women are so incompetent, 
	16 I'm gonna have smart-ass men rule over you, since you're so damn retarded!", he shouted. 
	<span class="spl">17-19 Sky Daddy swore a lot, </span>
	20 and Adam comforted Eve. 
	21 Sky Daddy then slew some animals and made some makeshift clothes for the pair. 
	22 Well, 
	23 if you're gonna be fukken sinners, 
	24 you should look the part. 
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>
	1 Adam had fun sexytimes with Eve, and she shat out a kid called Cain, and said, "Jesus Christ!", to which Adam replied, "Who?". 
	2 She made another and called him Abel. She told Abel to be a shepard, and Cain to be a farmer. 
	3 So Cain grew some fruit and, being the loveable scamp he was, offered it to the kind diety who moments earlier cursed their entire species. 
	4 Meanwhile, Abel killed some sheep to appease this blood god. And Sky Daddy bathed in the blood, 
	5 and dissed Cain's shitty salad. Cain did not like this, and lectured Sky Daddy on veganism, 
	6 to which Sky Daddy replied, "U mad, 
	7 bro?". 
	8 So Cain brutally slew Abel and proptly began to throatfuck him. 
	9 Then Sky Daddy said to Cain, "Where the fuck is Abel?", to which he replied, "Uhhhhhhh...", 
	<span class="spl">10-12 and Sky Daddy raged, </span>
	13 Cain said, "pls no",
	14 but Sky Daddy said, "Oh yes!", 
	15 and did a poof on Cain, 
	16 and Cain fled, 
	<span class="spl">17-22 and generations later, one of his descendants, </span>
	23 Lamech, said to his wives, "I killed another guy, 
	24 so we're gonna be even more cursed now." 
	25 Meanwhile, Adam was still fucking his wife, and she shat out a kid called Seth, 
	26 who fathered a kid called Enos. 
	
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_5">Chapter 5</h2>
<p>
	<span class="del">1-3 </span>
	<span class="spl">4-32 Generations later, this guy Noah existed. </span>
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_6">Chapter 6</h2>
<p>
	<span class="del">1-4 </span>
	5 Sky Daddy saw how dirty the thoughts of the people were, 
	6 and he regretted ever making these guys, 
	7 so he was like, "Eh fuck it, I'll just kill everything.".
	8 But then he realized that one dude Noah was actually pretty chill. 
	<span class="del">9-12 </span>
	8 So he told Noah, "I'm sick of all this violence on the Earth, so I'm going to just kill everything, 
	<span class="spl">14-16 so make a reeeeally big boat, </span>
	<span class="spl">17-20 and put all the aminals in it. </span>
	21 Oh, and don't forget to pack snacks.", 
	22 so Noah did that. 
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_7">Chapter 7</h2>
<p>
	<span class="del">1-3 </span>
	4 And Sky Daddy said, "For seven days I will flood the world, and kill all the aminals, especially the cute, innocent bunnyrabbits. Fuck those little shits.". 
	<span class="del">5-8 </span>
	<span class="mov">14-15 All the aminals entered the boat, </span>
	9 and as Noah entered the boat, 
	<span class="mov">16 Sky Daddy slammed the door on his slow ass, </span>
	10 and flooded the world. 
	<span class="del">13</span>
	<span class="mov">24 Sky Daddy, filled with benevolent rage, decided to flood the world for a half a year instead of the seven days he said before, </span>
	<span class="del">17-20 </span>
	<span class="spl">21-23 and everything died.</span> 
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_8">Chapter 8</h2>
<p>
	1 Then after all that time, Sky Daddy remembered Noah only had enough food for a week and said, "Oh shit, I forgot Noah.", and got rid of all that flooding. 
	<span class="del">2-3 </span>
	4 As the water drained, the boat came to rest on a big-ass mountain. 
	<span class="del">5 </span>
	6 Noah exited the boat, 
	7 and sent a raven 
	8 and a dove to check to see if it was dry yet, 
	9 but the birds were like, "Nope". 
	10 A week of doing this though, 
	11 and the dove finally came back with an olive branch, and Noah was like "Woah, a tree that grew in just a week!". 
	12 So he waited one more week, just to be sure, before getting everyone off, 
	<span class="del">13-14 </span>
	<span class="spl">15-19 and Sky Daddy gave Noah a pat on the back. </span> 
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_9">Chapter 9</h2>
<p>
	1 Sky Daddy told Noah, "Make sure you guys fuck a lot so the world repopulates, 
	2 and don't forget the animals are your bitches, so do whatever you want with them, idgaf.". 
	<span class="del">3-7 </span>
	8 Sky Daddy also added, 
	<span class="del">9-12 </span>
	<span class="spl">13-16 "I kinda feel bad for killing everything, but here's a rainbow!". </span>
	<span class="del">17-20 </span>
	21 Noah, rightfully so, got totally wasted, and lay naked in his shack. 
	22 Ham, his son, had some fun with Noah in his state, but then told his brothers, 
	23 and as they were throwing a blanket on him, 
	24 Noah woke up. He knew Ham raped him, and said, 
	25 "Dude you and your descendants are soooo cursed for eternity!", 
	26 and they really were. 
	<span class="del">27-29 </span>
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_10">Chapter 10</h2>
<p>
	<span class="spl">1-32 Years later, </span>
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_11">Chapter 11</h2>
<p>
	1 and everyone was still speaking the same language. 
	2 Coming to a nice spot, 
	3 they gathered their resources, 
	4 and built a reaaaally big tower. 
	5 Sky Daddy, seeing this happen, 
	6 and realizing their power, 
	<span class="spl">7-9 decided to fuck with them and make them all speak different languages. </span>
	<span class="add">- "Serves you right for trying to cooperate!", he said, </span>
	<span class="spl">10-32 and many years of confusion passed. </span>
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_12">Chapter 12</h2>
<p>
	1 Sky Daddy found this guy Abraham and told him to leave and 
	2 make his own better country, with blackjack and hookers. 
	<span class="del">3 </span>
	4 And, seeing as how Sky Daddy was pretty powerful, Abraham set out to do that, 
	5 with his wife Sarai, and nephew Lot. 
	<span class="del">6-9 </span>
	<span class="spl">10-11 On the way, however, there were Egyptians, </span>
	12 who would kill Sarai if she was Abraham's wife. 
	13 So Abraham tells Sarai to just lie to them if they ask. 
	14 When they came into Egypt, 
	15 Pharaoh was like, "I'd tap that", and took her into his place, 
	16 and let Abraham stay outside, if he'd like. 
	17 But Sky Daddy, forgetting it was Sarai who lied, cursed poor the pharaoh for banging her. 
	<span class="spl">18-19 Finally remembering, however, he briefly chastized Abraham </span>
	20 before they left. 
</p>
<h3 id="Genesis_25">Chapter 25</h2>
<p>
	1 Abraham married Keturah, 
	<span class="spl">2-4 who shat out many children. </span>
	5 Abraham dies, and gives everything he has to his kid Isaac, 
	6 and some consolation prizes to his other useless children. 
	<span class="del">7-19 </span>
	<span class="spl">20-23 Isaac bitched to Sky Daddy that he was impotent, so Sky Daddy whipped up some magic and popped a baby into his wife Rebecca. </span>
	24 She had twins, 
	25 which they called Esau, 
	26 and Jacob. 
	27 Esau became a hunter, and Jacob was a househusband. 
	28 Isaac loved Esau cause he wasn't a sissy like Jacob, but Rebecca loved Jacob anyways. 
	29 One day, coming home,  
	30 Esau asked Jacob for soup, 
	31 to which Jacob said he would only concede for Esau's birthright. 
	32 Since Esau was so starved he would die anyways, it seemed silly to hold onto it, 
	33 so he agreed. 
	34 Esau, realizing how dumb that was, immediately regretted the stupid fucking soup. 
</p>

<h2 id="Exodus">Exodus</h2>

This book would take place c. 1250 BCE. 

<h3 id="Exodus_1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>
	1 Jacob, 
	<span class="del">2-4 </span>
	5 and seventy others came to Egypt, 
	<span class="del">6 </span>
	7 and fucked lots. 
	8 Then there was a new king 
	<span class="spl">9-10 who, out of fear of their numbers, </span>
	11 made them slaves, 
	12 but this only made them fuck even more, 
	<span class="spl">13-14 so they gave them increasingly shitty work.</span>
	15 The king, realizing the situation, declared 
	16 that all newborn sons should be killed. 
	17 Strangely, the mothers were reluctant to do this. 
	18 The king asked why, 
	19 and they replied, "Because they're our fucking children, that's why!". 
	<span class="del">20-21 </span>
	22 Naturally, the king ordered his people to chuck the babies into the river. 
</p>
<h3 id="Exodus_2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>
	1 There was a woman, however, 
	2 who shat out a kiddo, and hid him for a few months, 
	3 and when she realized she could no longer hide him, put him in a basket and sent him down the river. 
	<span class="del">4 </span>
	5 The Pharaoh's daughter came to the river to bathe, and when she saw the basket, she sent a maid to fetch it. 
	6 She opened it and saw the child, 
	<span class="spl">7-9 took him in, </span>
	10 and named him Moses. 
	11 Years later Moses saw a guy beating the shit out of this Hebrew and, 
	12 making sure there were no witnesses, decapitated the shit outta that Egyptian. 
	13 The Hebrew said, "Why?".
	14 Moses realized he was in deep shit, 
	15 fled to Midian, 
	<span class="del">16-20 </span>
	<span class="spl">21-22 and knocked up this chick Zipporah.</span>
	23 Meanwhile, Pharaoh died.
	<span class="del">24-25 </span>
</p>
<h3 id="Exodus_3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p>
	1 One day, when Moses was in the mountains, 
	2 Sky Daddy appeared to him in the form of a burning bush. 
	3 When Moses saw this, 
	4 Sky Daddy told him, "Listen, 
	5 kick of your shoes, we're gonna be a while. 
	<span class="del">6 </span>
	7 So, I notice how the Hebrews are getting beat the fuck outta by the Egyptians, 
	8 and I'm here to help, 
	<span class="del">9 </span>
	10 and I'm gonna do this by ordering you to go to Egypt and do all this for me.", 
	11 to which Moses rightfully replied, "Can't you just do this?", 
	12 to which Sky Daddy said, "No, but I'm rooting for you, buddy! Go get 'em, tiger!". 
	13 Moses, curious, said, "Can I at least get a name man?", to which Sky Daddy impatiently replied, 
	<span class="spl">14-15 "My name doesn't matter, </span>
	<span class="spl">16-19 just go already! </span>
	20 Smite those Egyptian fucks!
	<span class="del">21 </span>
	22 Pillage the bastards!".
</p>
<h3 id="Exodus_20">Chapter 20</h2>
<p>
	1 Sky Daddy said, 
	2 "Yo, I mean serious business, 
	3 you'd better not believe in FSM, or any other of those posers,  
	<span class="mov">5 cause I'm yandere as fuck!</span>
	4 Don't draw fanart 
	<span class="del">6 </span>
	7 or twist my words, 
	<span class="spl">8-11 and remember that Sunday's special. </span>
	12 Don't fuck with your rents, 
	13 or kill, 
	<span class="add">- unless, I mean, I told you to, </span>
	14 don't commit adultery, 
	15 or steal, 
	16 or perjure, 
	17 and don't covet your neighbor's ass, unless it is extremely tappable!", 
	18 and with thunder and lightning, it was spoken. 
	19 Everyone panicked, 
	20 but Moses helped them chill, 
	21 and he approached Sky Daddy. 
	22 "Well? What are you waiting for?!", Sky Daddy said. 
	23 "Oh, and don't make me an altar of Gold or Silver, 
	<span class="spl">24-25 but rather simple things.", he added. </span>
	<span class="del">26 </span>
</p>

<h2 id="Joshua">Joshua</h2>

This book would possibly take place c. 1200 BCE. 

<h3 id="Joshua_1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>
	<span class="spl">1-2 Moses died. </span>
	<span class="spl">3-4 "Go,", he said, </span>
	5 "no man shall be able to stop you, 
	6 be brave, 
	7 and be bold.". 
	<span class="del">8-9 </span>
	<span class="spl">10-17 So Josh and the gang left, </span>
	18 but not before, of course, threatening to kill anyone who dare disobey. 
</p>
<h3 id="Joshua_2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>
	1 Joshua sent two spies to scout the area, but instead they slept with some sexy cockslut. 
	2 They were so loud about this that even the King of Jericho soon heard about this, 
	3 and the king ordered the men be brought before him. 
	4 His soldiers asked the woman where they were, 
	5 but she gave false directions, 
	6 as they hid upstairs. 
	7 So the soldiers left, 
	8 and she went upstairs, 
	<span class="spl">9-11 and said, "Please, I'm scared, </span>
	12 please don't hurt me, 
	13 or my family!", 
	14 to which the men agreed, 
	15 and as they left, 
	16 she wished them luck. 
	<span class="del">17-22 </span>
	23 When they returned, 
	24 they told Josh everyone was scared shitless of Sky Daddy. 
</p>
<h3 id="Joshua_10">Chapter 10</h2>
<p>
	1 The King of Jerusalem heard of Josh's conquest of Ai, Jericho, and how Gibeon peaced out, 
	2 and was scared shitless. 
	3 He sent a letter to the kings of Hebron, Jarmuth, and Lachish, saying, 
	4 "Hyeeeeeelp!", 
	5 so they did. 
	<span class="del">6-7 </span>
	8 But Sky Daddy was with Josh, 
	<span class="del">9 </span>
	10 and fucked the shit outta their armies, 
	11 and then it started hailing super hard. 
	12 Then Josh told the sun and moon to stand still, 
	13 and they did. 
	<span class="del">14-15 </span>
	16 The kings fled to a cave, 
	17 but Josh found them, 
	18 and sealed the enterance to the cave. 
	19 "Take no prisoners, kill 'em all!", 
	20 and they slaughtered everyone. 
	21 Afterwards, 
	<span class="spl">22-23 Josh opened the cave, </span>
	<span class="spl">24-26 to hang the kings, </span>
	27 throw their bodies back into the cave, and reseal the cave. 
	28 That same day, they captured Makkedah, and chopped the king's head off, 
	<span class="spl">29-30 and slaughtered the city of Libnah too, </span>
	<span class="spl">31-32 and Lachish, </span>
	33 and the army of Gezer, 
	<span class="spl">34-35 and Eglon, </span>
	<span class="spl">36-37 and Hebron, </span>
	<span class="spl">38-39 and Debir. </span>

This book takes place c. 28 CE. 

<h3 id="Mark_1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>
	<span class="del">1-3 </span>
	4 This guy John was in the desert baptizing. 
	5 So lots came to him, and were all baptized in the Jordan, and confessed their sins, which were, of course, as numerous as could be. 
	6 John was wearing a chic camelskin cloak with belt, eating ants on a log, and generally acting gay. 
	7 He announced, "Someone even cooler than me's coming, so cool I'm not even allowed to kiss his ass.  
	8 Where I baptized with water, he'll baptize with his Spirit.".
	9 Soon after, Jesus came from Nazareth so John could baptize him in the Jordan. His was a long one, and John had to cut him off after he started on about a threesome with two other guys. 
	10 When he finally came up from the water, the sky cleared, and the Spirit shot into him like some fukken laser, and he started spazzing out and shit. 
	11 A voice behind the clouds whispered, "Dis gun be gud", 
	12 and the Spirit bamfed him into the desert. 
	13 He was there for a whole fukken month, and the sinmaster tempted him with wild animals, but sexy angels distracted him, so he was good. 
	14 Meanwhile, they got John for possession, again, and, when Jesus came back, and said, 
	15 "It's miracle time.". 
	16 As he took a leisurely stroll by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and bro Andy, casting a net into the sea, as they were fishermen, 
	17 and he said, "Come with me, and I'll make you fishers of men.", to which they replied, "Dude, you're fucking stoned.", 
	18 but, since they were totally bored, decided to go along with it anyways. 
	19 On the way, he saw Zebedee's kids Jim and John, who were also fucking with nets. 
	20 He called them, and they also came, since fishing is gay. 
	21 <!--When the Sabbath came, -->They went to the synagogue in Capernaum and preached. 
	22 Everyone thought his preaching was super cool, 
	23 except this one asswipe who said, 
	24 "Fuck you!", 
	25 and Jesus said, "No, fuck you!", 
	26 and he totally exorcised this wicked-ass ghoul thing outta him. 
	27 Everyone clapped. 
	28 OP Jesus went unnerfed, and the exploit became renowned throughout the community. 
	29 After they left the synagogue, they went to Simon and Andy's place, with Jim and John. 
	30 Simon's mother-in-law had a really bad cold, so they told Jesus, 
	31 and Jesus bamfed the cold away. 
	32 In the evening everyone brought their sick and possessed to Jesus, 
	33 and they watched all night as 
	34 he told the demon after demon to fuck off, and they all fucked off. 
	35 In the morning, Jesus reminisced on the good times. 
	36 Simon and the gang went to look for him, 
	37 and when they found him they said, 
	38 "Dude let's do this the next town over!", 
	39 and they did. 
	40 There was even this sick-ass leper dude who 
	41 Jesus 
	42 cured, 
	43 and he went about his merry way. 
	44 The gang all went, "Woah", 
	45 and everyone around was like, "Woah".

	1 When he came back to Capernaum, word spread fast. 
	2 It was so fucking crowded you couldn't breathe, but, always the people pleaser, he preached anyways. 
	3 They brought him to this dude with palsy, 
	4 who was lying in bed, 
	5 and he forgave his sins. 
	6 But there were these guys who were all like, 
	7 "But only Sky Daddy can forgive!", 
	8 and Jesus was like, "First off, buddy, 
	9 it's like waaaay easier to just forgive sins than to actually, you know, cure him or someshit, 
	10 and second, I AM Sky Daddy, and I accept your dare!", 
	11 and then Jesus cured the palsy guy. 
	12 He started running around all gay-like, cause I guess that's something guys with palsy do or someshit. 
	13 Later he preached by the sea, 
	14 and as he strolled by, he saw Alphaeus' kid Levi pissing around, and said, "Follow me, dude.", and he did. 
	15 Later, as Jesus was eating dinner in his house, a lotta guys also sat with him and his disciples. 
	16 When some guys saw him eat with all these fags, they said, "Why you eating with these fags?". 
	17 So Jesus said, "I'm helping them not sin.".
