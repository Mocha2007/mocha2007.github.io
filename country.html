<p>
	Emperor Tigerstar recently made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFLrLkPDJjI">a video</a> (on 01 Nov 2017) about what country, nation, and state mean. 
	The debate was analyzed from a more historical point of view, and I thought it would be nice to look at the issue linguistically, with commentary, to shine the light at another angle. 
	This page is aimed at English learners, but secondarily to native speakers interested in etymology and semantics. 
</p>
<h1>Empire</h1>
<ol>
	<li>A territory ruled by an emperor.</li>
	<li>A country with imperialistic tendencies.</li>
	<li>A powerful entity.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Don't even bother looking for a consistent defintion of empire - 
	these definitions are typically inconsistent prescriptivist nonsense. 
	Typically, whether a country is an empire or not depends on what definition you mean. 
	I list the preceding three definitions, roughly in descending order of how common they are. 
	Note that the third definition I list is <i>not</i> limited to countries! 
	For example, this sentence, slightly reworded from Wiktionary:
</p>
<q>
	McDonald's is a fast food empire.
</q>
<p>
	Nobody is insinuating that McDonald's is some sort of nation weilding an army or someshit. 
	This sentence simply states that McDonald's dominates the fast-food market. 
</p>
<p>
	Likewise, I can say the following: 
</p>
<q>
	Iraq is the latest state of the American Empire.
</q>
<p>
	The United States is clearly not ruled by an emperor, rather, the one saying this would be implying that the United States has such imperialistic tendencies. 
	The speaker would also likely have very strong views on the American occupation of Iraq! 
</p>
<p>
	And, finally, edited from the Wikipedia article on the Byzantine Empire:
</p>
<q>
	The Byzantine Empire was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.
</q>
<p>
	This follows the first definiton, and the most common. The Byzantine Empire was, in fact, ruled by an emperor.
</p>
<p>
	Etymologically, <i>empire</i> comes from Latin via French, as many words do. 
	In Latin, the word had a much broader definition. 
	In addition to the first definition, <i>imperium</i> also, roughly, meant "control", "law", or even "order" (ie. a command). 
	<i>Imperium</i> comes from <i>impero</i>, a verb meaning <i>command</i>, which is a prefixed form of the verb <i>paro</i>, meaning <i>prepare</i> or <i>arrange</i>. 
	<i>Paro</i> ultimately comes from Proto-Indo-European <i>*per-</i>, meaning <i>bring forth</i>. 
	<i>*per-</i> also brings us native English words such as <i>fare</i> and <i>ferry</i>. 
</p>

<h1>Country</h1>
<ol>
	<li>A sovereign state.</li>
	<li>A rural area.</li>
	<li>A province in a sovereign state.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Usually, when refering to a 'soverign state', people use the word 'country', unless they're being uptight pedants, in which case they use confusing and contradictory language to demonstrate how smart they are, or someshit. 
	This word, thankfully, nearly universally refers to the first definition, though you often see country used in the second definition, like in <i>country music</i>. 
	Occasionally, certain provinces in countries are themselves called <i>countries</i>, for example, <i>Basque Country</i>, a province of Spain. 
</p>
<p>
	Etymologically, <i>country</i> comes from Latin via French, yet again. 
	It is abbreviated from <i>terra contrata</i>, or 'the land opposite'. 
	<i>Contrata</i> is a Vulgar Latin word from Latin <i>contra</i>, meaning 'opposite' or 'against'. 
	<i>Contra</i> was formed from Latin <i>cum</i> 'with', by analogy with <i>intra</i> 'within'. 
	<i>Cum</i> comes from Proto-Indo-European <i>*k&oacute;m</i> meaning 'with' or 'next to'.
