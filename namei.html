<p>
	The <b>Akkaha</b> is a major <a href="#pankair">Pankairian</a> river. 
	It is 2,344 km long, just longer than the Colorado. 
	Its Hausdorff dimension is approximately 1.18.<!--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski–Bouligand_dimension , ln(1537)/ln(491)-->
	On its mouth is situated <a href="#eremor">Eremor</a>.

<p>
	<b>Eisen</b> is a large gas giant, slightly more than nine times the mass of Jupiter, and thus it is the second-largest body in the <a href="#namei">Namei</a> system, comprising just over 1% the total mass. <!--9.0586-->
	It has many cloud bands, most of which alternate between <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/cfb964">dark khaki</a> and <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/797960">olive</a>, except one band in the northern hemisphere, which is decidedly <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/f5e885">khaki</a>. 
	There exist numerous temporary light-colored storms, but no permanent storms like our own Jupiter. 
	The planet has a faint ring system, only visible from Maia during an eclipse of Namei from Eisen. 
	Its rotation period is just over seven hours.
</p>
<p>
	It has four major moons, one of which is an ice giant (<a href="#seter">Seter</a>), and hundreds of minor moons, mostly captured asteroids in temporary orbits.
	The four major moons, in order, are: 
	<!--
	Uto		514.26 Mm
	Bolt	816.336 Mm
	Seter	1.295852 Gm
	Maia	1.8 Gm
	-->
	<ul>
		<li><b>Uto</b>, an extremely geologically active moon half the mass of Earth with an atmosphere similar too, but somehow even <i>hotter</i> than Venus (Not by much - just 20K hotter). Its orbital and rotation periods, by sheer coincidence, happen to be exactly 19 hours and 1 second.</li>
		<li><b>Bolt</b>, very similar to Uto, but two-thirds the mass of Earth and with a thinner atmosphere, which leads to the temperature being only about 20 Celcius warmer than Earth. Its orbital and rotation periods are both just over thirty-eight hours. Both Bolt and Uto look almost exactly like Venus, but a bit darker (especially Bolt).</li>
		<li><b><a href="#seter">Seter</a></b>, an ice giant moon.</li>
		<li><b><a href="#maia">Maia</a></b>, which contains life.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The inner three major moons are in a 1:2:4 resonance, just like the Galileian moons. 
	No moons lie within the rings, but there are four small asteroid moons just outside the ring system.

	<!--Abstract (aka Spoilers)-->
	Eremor is the cradle of <a href="#pankair">Pankairian</a> civilization, and the capital of <a href="#eremora">Eremora</a>. 
	It contains 15,000 people. 
	Much of it sits on the mouth of the <i><a href="#akkaha">Akkaha</a></i>, safe and secure on almost all sides. 
	Despite its enormous power the capital province itself is quite small - about one-third the area of Hong Kong. 
	The king's castle and administrative center is located on a large, heavily-fortified island (<i><a href="#victoryisland">Victory Island</a></i>) at its mouth. 
	Much of the remaining city is protected by the Great Wall of Eremor, which is just over ten kilometers long. 
	From Eremor, totality of solar eclipses can last longer then 14 minutes. 
</p>
<p>
	<!--History-->
	Written history began two thousand years ago, when a culture with an unknown name (<i>Proto-Eremorans</i>) first started constructing cities in the area. 
	These cities likely engaged in trade with each other and other neighboring cultures, including the Eremorans. 
	About one millenium after the first written records, the Eremorans, a local culture, conquered Eremor, and soon after, much of the lower river basin. 
	Within a few centuries all of the Proto-Eremorans were assimilated into Eremoran culture, and all that remains of the mother culture is a handful of loans and myths. 
	The hydronyms <i>Akkaha</i> and <i>Akkahan</i> are widely believed to be such loans. 
</p>
<p><!--Climate

	The city has a hot semi-arid climate (K&ouml;ppen BSh), with three main seasons: summer, monsoon and winter. 
	The bay area itself receives much less precipitation during the monsoon than the areas east. 
	The city and surrounding province is located in plant hardiness zone 12a. 
</p>
<p>
	<!--Structures and Features-->
	Due to the width of the <i>Akkaha</i> and significant seismic activity, there is no bridge to the smaller part of the city on the opposite bank (<i>Other Bank</i> district). 
	This side is mostly populated by fishers and farmers who use reed boats to cross the river. 
	These small boats are the property of the community and may be used by anyone.

<h2 id="maia">Maia</h2>
<p>
	<b>Maia</b> is a major moon of <a href="#eisen">Eisen</a>. 
	It is slightly more massive <!--1.039--> and slightly larger <!--1.1163--> than Earth. 
	Its orbital and rotation periods are just under five and one-sixth Earth days. 
	Its surface pressure is a little over two and a half that of Earth's, and its surface temperature is 96K. <!--methane: 90.7 K 124.1 K-->
	The atmospheric composition is roughly 59% H<sub>2</sub>, 39% N<sub>2</sub>, 1.6% CH<sub>4</sub> (highly variable to region), and some trace noble gases and hydrocarbons. 
	Because of these conditions which are clearly ideal to life, it too contains intelligent civilizations.
</p>
<p>
	From Maia, when Eisen is in its full phase, it appears four times brighter than the full moon. Uto appears 32 times dimmer, Bolt 17 times, and <a href="#seter">Seter</a> 3 times dimmer. 
	All major moons are visible during day, if they are above the horizon. 
	The minor moons are never brighter than Regulus, and thus can only be seen when neither Eisen nor Namei can be seen. 
	The four inner minor moons have a maximum apparent magnitude that of Procyon, the eigth-brightest star in the night sky, but can dive to ninth magnitude in suboptimal conditions. Thus, they can all be easily seen for about half a local day. 
	For the near side, this is the two hours Maia is Eclipsed by Eisen during the eclipsing seasons. 
	For the far side, it is the half of the local day these are below the horizon.
	Even in the worst positions, they are never dimmer than sixth magnitude, and thus are easily viewable when one is away from major cities. 
	It is occasionally eclipsed by the other three inferior major moons, especially Seter. 
	Seter can appear very large from Maia (up to eight times the diameter of how the moon appears to us!), but never larger than Eisen. 
	Since Eisen appears so bright when it is full, the entire moon is essentially in perpetual day for several hours.
<p>

<h2 id="maians">Maians</h2>
<p>
	<b>Maians</b> are the second-most advanced species of the unusually fortunate <a href="#namei">Namei</a> system. 
	Their advancement is comparable to mid-19th century Earth. 
	They know of all the planets but Dicito and Mannu, the furthest out. 
</p>
<p>
	According to their top scientists, other bodies in the Namei system are unable to harbor life, due to their atmospheres containing an excess of the toxic molucules sulfur dioxide and molecular oxygen. 
	Some theorize exotic "water-based" life could exist on <a href="#oneia">Oneia</a> or <a href="#nikki">its recently discovered moon</a>, using hypothetical "lipids" instead of the normal acrylonitrile cell membranes all known life uses. 
	Of course, these so-called "lipids" not only do not occur naturally, but have also been failed to be synthesized in a laboratory! 
	Such "water-based" life would also have to deal with the damaging effects of using such a chemically reactive substance, a struggle methane-based life does not face. 
	Even if <i>somehow</i> such life could exist, it is unlikely to have developed metalworking due to the strong corrosive effects of water, damaging any tools made beyond repair. 
	Thus, even if intelligent water-based life existed, it could not develop the tools necessary to approach glorious Maian intelligence.

<h2 id="namei">Namei</h2>
<p>
	<b>Namei</b> is the star of the system. 
	Its spectral class is K5V, and the star is about 4 billion years old. 
	The planets <a href="#oneia">Oneia</a> and <a href="#eisen">Eisen</a> orbit this star, along with:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Ara</b> is a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/f6e397">khaki</a> rocky planet with a mass more than six times that of Earth. Its atmosphere and appearance are very similar to Venus. It is tidally locked to Namei, with a period of four and a half Earth days. Despite its extreme proximity to Namei, it has three asteroid moons, the largest being the size of Hyperion.</li>
		<li><b><a href="#falto">Falto</a></b></li>
		<li>The <b>Inner Asteroid Belt</b>, including <b>Tata</b>, a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/c7b582">tan</a> dwarf planet with similar size and appearance to our own moon. It has two asteroid moons. It is tidally locked, with a period of 21 earth days.</li>
		<li><b>Bau</b>, a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/b99e69">tan</a> planet with similar size to Mercury, but has the appearance of Venus, but without the heat. Its rotation period is exactly two-thirds its orbital period, which is 36 days. It has five asteroid moons.</li>

It is tidally locked to its only moon, an object similar in size to Varda of our own solar system, with an orbital period of about fourty-three hours. Unlike its parent, the moon has a normal albedo for objects of its kind (~0.1), making it likely captured.</li>
		<li><b>Neuve</b>, a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/7ca1ae">light blue</a> ice giant five-thirds the mass of Neptune. It has eight major moons and fourteen asteroid moons.</li>
		<li><b>Dicito</b>, a migrated Kuiper belt object thirty-three times the mass of Don, with an essentially identical appearance. It has six major moons, and eleven asteroid moons.</li>
		<li><b>Mannu</b>, a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/8ba290">sea green</a> gas giant with a mass two-thirds that of jupiter. It has nine major moons, and dozens of asteroid moons. The largest of these moons is three-halves the mass of Earth. Its orbital period is 115 Earth years, the longest of any planet in the Namei system.</li>
		<li>The <b>Kuiper belt</b>, and beyond</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	All the planets inferior to Don have been known since antiquity to all Nameian civilizations. 
	Don has only recently been discovered by the Nikki and Maians; it is always dimmer than Neptune from Earth. 
	Neuve was known since antiquity for all civilizations; its maximum brightness is 23% higher than that of Uranus from Earth.
	Dicito is only 85% brighter than Pluto at best, and was only just recently discovered by the Nikki. 
	Mannu is 28% dimmer than Neptune, and was also only just recently discovered by the Nikki. Both are unknown to other Nameian Civilizations.

<h2 id="nikki">Nikki</h2>
<p>
	<b>Nikki</b> is a tidally locked moon of <a href="#oneia">Oneia</a>. 
	Like Oneia, Nikki is also inhabited. 
	Nikki is about 1/3 water by area.
	The entire world is constrolled by the <a href="#nikkiempire">Nikki Empire</a>.
	The technology is roughly that of 1950s Earth.
</p>

<h2 id="nikkiempire">Nikki Empire</h2>
<p>
	The <b>Nikki Empire</b> has, in various, sometimes fractured forms, controlled <a href="#nikki">Nikki</a> for most of recorded history. 
	In the earliest recovered fragments of text, it seems they only stretched for a small fraction of the world. 
	A few hundred years after the recorded history, emperor <i>Ntusint the Great</i> conquered most of the remaining world, save for a few sparsely populated regions. 
	It was not until contemporary times the empire was able to extend its reach to these remotest of places. 
	The Empire is 800 Million people strong. 
	While the moon once spoke many languages, all of these have since been surplanted by the <a href="nikki.html">Nikki Language</a>.<!--MAKE LINK ONG)-->

	<!--Orbital-->
	<b>Oneia</b> is a planet orbiting <a href="#namei">Namei</a>. 
	It orbits 0.32 au away and has a period of 75 earth days, or just over 62 Oneian days. 
	Oneia has one major moon, <a href="#nikki">Nikki</a>, along with some minor moons and a planetary ring. 
</p>
<p>
	<!--Eclipses-->
	Solar Eclipses follow cycles similar to Earth, with the 1-month, 62-month, 311-month, and 684-month cycles being the most important. 
	684 local months is only 37 <i>minutes</i> longer than 11 local years. 
	Compare this to the Metonic cycle, which loses 4 <i>hours</i>, despite it being extremely close to perfect. 
	311 local months is only 2 hours, 21 minutes longer than 5 local years, and 62 local months is only 5 hours, 19 minutes shorter than 1 local year. 
	Eclipses each of these cycles tend to be very similar to the last. 
	Because of Nikki's inclination, there are specific seasons when eclipses can happen, convering about two-thirds of the orbit. 
	These seasons contain about 21 solar eclipses each. 
	Any particular location will have about four totality events in each of these eclipse seasons. 
</p>
<p>
	<!--Showers-->
	There are six major meteor showers throughout the year:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>11th of Spring - Vernal Nwarbid Shower Peak</li>
	<li>12th of Spring - Vernal Oikhurtid Shower Peak</li>
	<li>3rd of Summer - Millenniids Shower Peak</li>
	<li>9th of Summer - Aestive Oikhurtids Shower Peak</li>
	<li>5th of Autumn - Autumnal Nwarbid Shower Peak</li>
	<li>11th of Autumn - Na'unid Shower Peak</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<!--Zodiac-->
	In Eremoran skyculture, there are thirty-two constellation. Twelve are of the Eremoran Zodiac:
</p>
<ul>

	<li>Winter - The Drum</li>
	<li>Winter - The Bucket</li>

<p>
	<!--Geographic-->
	The planet is quite visually similar to earth. 
	However, Oneia's surface is covered by a significantly higher fraction of land; over two-fifths of the surface is land. 
	The planet and moon are tidally locked, with a period of just under 29 earth hours. 
	Since the moon is tidally locked, there is no Oneian equivalent to the terran concept of a 'month'. 
	The planet is significantly warmer and wetter than Earth, thus snow and aridity is rare and restricted to the extremes. 
</p>
<p>
	<!--Cultural-->
	The entire world is constrolled by various factions and races. 
	The technological development of the most advanced part of the planet is that of Earth's early iron age, 
	although it's not hard to find cultures still using bronze or stone tools. 
	The two continents containing iron-age civilizations are <a href="#pankair">Pankair</a> and <a href="#ora">Ora</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	<!--Rationalization of Nikki's Shimmer-->
	To Oneia, the appearance of the night side of Nikki is much like the night side of Earth. 
	To Oneians though, it just appears as if the moon shimmers in the dark, and since this is a relatively recent phenomenon, 
	there are few myths, and the great philosophers of the time argue over what causes the shimmering. 
	These theories range from the rational, great endless fires or noctilucent minerals, to the more paranormal, such as the spirits of the deceased.

	The temperate light bands are by far the largest, taking perhaps as much as three-quarters the surface. 
	An interesting "chrome" effect happens in the darker bands when one views the outer limb of the atmosphere. 
	The effect is visible on Eisen too, but is far more subtle. It is thought to be caused by clouds of ice in the upper atmosphere.
