<h2 id="namei">Namei</h2>
<p>
	<b>Namei</b> is the star of the system. 
	Its spectral class is K5V, and is about 4 billion years old. 
	The planet <a href="#oneia">Oneia</a> orbits this star.
</p>

<h2 id="nikki">Nikki</h2>
<p>
	<b>Nikki</b> is a tidally locked moon of <a href="#oneia">Oneia</a>. 
	Like Oneia, Nikki is also inhabited. 
	Nikki is about 1/3 water by area.
	The entire world is constrolled by the <a href="#nikkiempire">Nikki Empire</a>.
	The technology is roughly that of 1950s Earth.
</p>

<h2 id="nikkiempire">Nikki Empire</h2>
<p>
	The <b>Nikki Empire</b> has, in various forms, controlled Nikki for the entirety of recorded history. 
	The Empire is 800 Million people strong. 
	While the moon once spoke many languages, all of these have since been surplanted by the <a href="nikki.html">Nikki Language</a>.<!--MAKE LINK ONG)-->

<p>
	<b>Oneia</b> is a planet orbiting <a href="#namei">Namei</a>. 
	It orbits 0.6859 au away and has a period of 235 earth days, or 195&frac14; Oneian days. 
	This equates to twenty-four weeks of eight days, and an extra week of three days, or four days on a leap year, at the end. 
	Since the moon is tidally locked, there is no Oneian equivalent to the terran concept of a 'month'. 
	Oneia has one major moon, <a href="#nikki">Nikki</a>, along with some minor moons and a planetary ring.
	The planet and moon are tidally locked, with a period of just under 29 earth hours.
	The entire world is constrolled by various factions and races.
	The technology is roughly that of 5th century CE Earth.
