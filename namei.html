<h2 id="eisen">Eisen</h2>
<p>
	<b>Eisen</b> is a large gas giant, slightly more than nine times the mass of Jupiter, and thus it is the second-largest body in the Namei system, comprising just over 1% the total mass. <!--9.0586-->
	It has many cloud bands, most of which alternate between a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/d79b52">moderate orange</a> and a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/7b5c41">dark moderate orange</a>, except one band in the northern hemisphere, which is decidedly a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/dba76c">soft orange</a>. 
	In the equator, there exists a large perpetual storm which is a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/606060">very dark grey</a>, and numerous temporary smaller light-colored storms. 
	The planet has a faint ring system, only visible from Maia during an eclipse of Namei from Eisen. 
	Its rotation period is just over seven hours.
</p>
<p>
	It has four major moons, one of which is an ice giant (<a href="#seter">Seter</a>), and hundreds of minor moons, mostly captured asteroids in temporary orbits.
	The four major moons, in order, are: 
	<ul>
		<li><b>Uto</b>, an extremely geologically active moon half the mass of Earth with an atmosphere similar too, but somehow even <i>hotter</i> than Venus (Not by much - just 20K hotter). Its orbital and rotation periods, by sheer coincidence, happen to be exactly 19 hours and 1 second.</li>
		<li><b>Bolt</b>, very similar to Uto, but two-thirds the mass of Earth and with a thinner atmosphere, which leads to the temperature being only about 20 Celcius warmer than Earth. Its orbital and rotation periods are both just over thirty-eight hours. Both Bolt and Uto look almost exactly like Venus, but a bit darker (especially Bolt).</li>
		<li><b><a href="#seter">Seter</a></b>, an ice giant moon.</li>
		<li><b><a href="#maia">Maia</a></b>, which contains life.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The inferior three major moons are in a 1:2:4 resonance, just like the Galileian moons. 
	No moons lie within the rings, but there are four small asteroid moons just outside the ring system. 
</p>

<h2 id="maia">Maia</h2>
<p>
	<b>Maia</b> is a major moon of <a href="#eisen">Eisen</a>. 
	It is slightly more massive <!--1.039--> and slightly larger <!--1.1163--> than Earth. 
	Its orbital and rotation periods are just under five and one-sixth Earth days. 
	Its surface pressure is a little over two and a half that of Earth's, and its surface temperature is 96K. <!--methane: 90.7 K 124.1 K-->
	The atmospheric composition is roughly 47% CO<sub>2</sub>, 39% N<sub>2</sub>, 9% Ar, 3.1% O<sub>2</sub>, 1.6% CH<sub>4</sub> (highly variable to region), and some trace noble gases and hydrocarbons. 
	Because of these conditions which are clearly ideal to life, it too contains intelligent civilizations, whose advancement is comparable to mid-19th century Earth. 
</p>
<p>
	From Maia, when Eisen is in its full phase, it appears four times brighter than the full moon. Uto appears 32 times dimmer, Bolt 17 times, and <a href="#seter">Seter</a> 3 times dimmer. 
	All are visible during day, if they are above the horizon. 
	The other major moons are never brighter than Regulus, and thus can only be seen when neither Eisen nor Namei can be seen. 
	Even in the worst positions, they are never dimmer than sixth magnitude, and thus are easily viewable when one is away from major cities. 
	Every orbit, Maia is eclipsed by Eisen for about two hours.
	It is occasionally eclipsed by the other three inferior major moons, especially Seter. 
	Seter can appear very large from Maia (up to eight times the diameter of how the moon appears to us!), but never larger than Eisen. 
	Since Eisen appears so bright when it is full, the entire moon is essentially in perpetual day for several hours.

<h2 id="namei">Namei</h2>
<p>
	<b>Namei</b> is the star of the system. 
	Its spectral class is K5V, and the star is about 4 billion years old. 
	The planets <a href="#oneia">Oneia</a> and <a href="#eisen">Eisen</a> orbit this star, along with:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Ara</b> is a rocky planet with a mass more than six times that of Earth. Its atmosphere and appearance are very similar to venus, and it is tidally locked to Namei, with a period of four and a half Earth days. Despite its extreme proximity to Namei, it has three asteroid moons, the largest being the size of Hyperion.</li>
		<li><b>Falto</b> is a tidally-locked hot Neptune with a period of ten Earth days. Its mass is a little under twice that of Neptune. It has one major moon the size and appearance of Tethys, and five asteroid moons.</li>
		<li>The <b>Inner Asteroid Belt</b>, including <b>Tata</b>, a dwarf planet with similar size and appearance to our own moon. It has two asteroid moons. It is tidally locked, with a period of 21 earth days.</li>
		<li><b>Bau</b>, a planet with similar size to Mercury, but has the appearance of Venus, but without the heat. Its rotation period is exactly two-thirds its orbital period, which is 65 days. It has five asteroid moons.</li>
		<li><b><a href="#oneia">Oneia</a></b></li>
		<li>The <b>Outer Asteroid Belt</b></li>
		<li><b><a href="#eisen">Eisen</a></b></li>
		<li><b>Don</b>, a planet just larger than Pluto; an extremely low-albedo (~0.02) migrated Kuiper belt object. It is tidally locked to its only moon, an object similar in size to Varda of our own solar system, with an orbital period of about fourty-three hours. Unlike its parent, the moon has a normal albedo for objects of its kind (~0.1), making it likely captured.</li>
		<li><b>Neuve</b>, an ice giant five-thirds the mass of Neptune. It has eight major moons and fourteen asteroid moons.</li>
		<li><b>Dicito</b>, a migrated Kuiper belt object thirty-three times the mass of Don, with an essentially identical appearance. It has six major moons, and eleven asteroid moons.</li>
		<li><b>Mannu</b>, a gas giant with a mass two-thirds that of jupiter. It has nine major moons, and dozens of asteroid moons. The largest of these moons is three-halves the mass of Earth. Its orbital period is 115 Earth years, the longest of any planet in the Namei system.</li>
		<li>The <b>Kuiper belt</b>, and beyond</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	All the planets inferior to Don have been known since antiquity to all Nameian civilizations. 
	Don has only recently been discovered by the Nikki and Maians; it is always dimmer than Neptune from Earth. 
	Neuve was known since antiquity for all civilizations; its maximum brightness is 23% higher than that of Uranus from Earth.
	Dicito is only 85% brighter than Pluto at best, and was only just recently discovered by the Nikki. 
	Mannu is 28% dimmer than Neptune, and was also only just recently discovered by the Nikki. Both are unknown to other Nameian Civilizations.
</p>

<h2 id="nikki">Nikki</h2>
<p>
	<b>Nikki</b> is a tidally locked moon of <a href="#oneia">Oneia</a>. 
	Like Oneia, Nikki is also inhabited. 
	Nikki is about 1/3 water by area.
	The entire world is constrolled by the <a href="#nikkiempire">Nikki Empire</a>.
	The technology is roughly that of 1950s Earth.
</p>

<h2 id="nikkiempire">Nikki Empire</h2>
<p>
	The <b>Nikki Empire</b> has, in various, sometimes fractured forms, controlled Nikki for the most of recorded history. 
	In the earliest recovered fragments of text, it seems they only stretched for a small fraction of the world. 
	A few hundred years after the recorded history, emperor <i>Ntusint the Great</i> conquered most of the remaining world, save for a few sparsely populated regions. 
	It was not until contemporary times the empire was able to extend its reach to these remotest of places. 
	The Empire is 800 Million people strong. 
	While the moon once spoke many languages, all of these have since been surplanted by the <a href="nikki.html">Nikki Language</a>.<!--MAKE LINK ONG)-->

<h2 id="oneia">Oneia</h2>
<img src="img/oneia-nikki.svg" width="700" alt="Oneia system, to scale.">
<div class="desc">(The Oneia system, excluding small moonlets, to scale)</div>
<p>
	<b>Oneia</b> is a planet orbiting <a href="#namei">Namei</a>. 
	It orbits 0.6859 au away and has a period of 235 earth days, or 195&frac14; Oneian days. 
	This equates to twenty-four weeks of eight days, and an extra week of three days, or four days on a leap year, at the end. 
	Since the moon is tidally locked, there is no Oneian equivalent to the terran concept of a 'month'. 
	Oneia has one major moon, <a href="#nikki">Nikki</a>, along with some minor moons and a planetary ring.
	The planet and moon are tidally locked, with a period of just under 29 earth hours.
	The entire world is constrolled by various factions and races.
	The technology is roughly that of 5th century CE Earth.
</p>

<h2 id="seter">Seter</h2>
<p>
	<b>Seter</b> is a major moon of <a href="#eisen">Eisen</a>. 
	It is just over eight Earth masses, about the size of Planet Nine. 
	Its orbital and rotation periods are three and one-sixth Earth days. 
	It is identical in composition and extremely similar in appearance to Eisen, but the banding is much less developed; 
	the poles contain the darker pigment, and from one pole to another the bands go dark-light-dark-light-dark-light-dark. 
	The temperate light bands are by far the largest, taking perhaps as much as three-quarters the surface. 
	The other bands of similar size to each other, and much smaller. 
	An interesting "chrome" effect happens in the darker bands when one views the outer limb of the atmosphere. 
	The effect is visible on Eisen too, but is far more subtle. It is thought to be caused by clouds of ice in the upper atmosphere.
