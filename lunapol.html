	The idea behind this document is a sort of hypothetical "what-if" -
	if I could, with the snap of a finger, magically transform the function of the US
	into what I think would be most ideal,
	regardless of how major or trivial or improbable the change,
	what would that ideal <em>look</em> like?
</p>
<p>
	No detail is too small, no change is too big to escape <em>this</em> loment.

</ul>
<h3>Constitutional Amendments</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Article I

	</li>
	<li>
		Amendment I
		<ul>
			<li>
				(TODO: This amendment needs clarification -

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Amendment XIII
		<ul>
			<li>Remove the penal exception clause.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>

			</li>
		</ul>
