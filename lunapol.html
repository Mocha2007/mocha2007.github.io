<p>
	The idea behind this document is a sort of hypothetical "what-if" -
	if I could, with the snap of a finger, magically transform the function of the US
	into what I think would be most ideal,
	regardless of how major or trivial or improbable the change,
	what would that ideal <em>look</em> like?
</p>
<p>
	No detail is too small, no change is too big to escape <em>this</em> loment.

	<li>Remove senate, reallocate seats to states by population, as with USHOR.</li>

			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

</ul>
