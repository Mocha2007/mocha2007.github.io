<p>
	The Digit Game is simple: you have a pool of the digits {1, 2, ..., 9}.
	You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide and combination of elements from this pool in any order you wish.
	Note that this means a digit can only ever appear once in a solution.

<h2>Solutions for 1,000</h2>
<p>
	The minimal solution must have more than three digits, since the largest number you can make with three is 7*8*9 = 504.
	2*7*8*9 = 1,008 is a near solution, but I don't think it's possible with only four digits.
	I was able to find the solution shown above requiring five digits.
	I haven't tried every possibility (just most) so it's possible you can do it in four, but I have many, many doubts.
</p>
<h2>Solutions for 10,000</h2>
<p>
	The minimal solution must have more than four digits, since the largest number you can make with four is 6*7*8*9 = 3,024.
	4*5*7*8*9 = 10,080 is a near solution, but I don't think it's possible with only five digits.
	I was able to find the solution shown above requiring six digits.
	I haven't tried every possibility (just most) so it's possible you can do it in five, but I have many, many doubts.
