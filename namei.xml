<def id="akkaha" content ='
	The Akkaha is a major Pankairian river. 
	It is 2,344 km long, just longer than the Colorado. 
	Its Hausdorff dimension is approximately 1.18.
	On its mouth is situated Eremor. 
	It empties into the Akkahan, part of the Southern Sea. 
'/>
<def id="eisen" content ='
	Eisen is a large gas giant, the fifth planet from Namei. It is slightly more than nine times the mass of Jupiter, and thus it is the second-largest body in the system, comprising just over 1% the total mass.
	It has many cloud bands, most of which alternate between dark khaki and olive, except one band in the northern hemisphere, which is decidedly khaki. 
	There exist numerous temporary light-colored storms, but no permanent storms like our own Jupiter. 
	The planet has a faint ring system, only visible from Maia during an eclipse of Namei from Eisen. 
	Its rotation period is just over seven hours.
'/>
<def id="eremor" content ='
	Eremor is the cradle of Pankairian civilization, and the capital of Eremora. 
	It contains 15,000 people. 
	Much of it sits on the mouth of the Akkaha, safe and secure on almost all sides. 
	Despite its enormous power the capital province itself is quite small - about one-third the area of Hong Kong. 
	The king&#39;s castle and administrative center is located on a large, heavily-fortified island (Victory Island) at its mouth. 
	Much of the remaining city is protected by the Great Wall of Eremor, which is just over ten kilometers long. 
	From Eremor, totality of solar eclipses can last longer then 14 minutes. 
'/>
<def id="eremora" content ='
	Eremora is the kingdom controlled by Eremor. 
	It spans an area of roughly 30,000 km2 and contains about 750,000 people. 
	They speak EremorÃ´m (Eremoran). 
	Eremorans themselves call Eremor and Eremora Eremor, but here they are separated for clarity. 
'/>
<def id="falto" content ='
	Falto is a tan tidally-locked hot Neptune orbiting Namei with a period of ten Earth days. 
	Its mass is a little under twice that of Neptune. 
	It has one major moon the size and appearance of Tethys, and five asteroid moons. 
'/>
<def id="kaznuk" content ='
	Kaznuk is an Oneian continent.
'/>
<def id="maia" content ='
	Maia is a major moon of Eisen. 
	It is slightly more massive and slightly larger than Earth. 
	Its orbital and rotation periods are just under five and one-sixth Earth days. 
	Its surface pressure is a little over two and a half that of Earth&#39;s, and its surface temperature is 96K.
	The atmospheric composition is roughly 59% H2, 39% N2, 1.6% CH4 (highly variable to region), and some trace noble gases and hydrocarbons. 
	Because of these conditions which are clearly ideal to life, it too contains intelligent civilizations.
'/>
<def id="maians" content ='
	Maians are the second-most advanced species of the unusually fortunate Namei system. 
	Their advancement is comparable to mid-19th century Earth. 
	They know of all the planets but Dicito and Mannu, the furthest out. 
'/>
<def id="namei" content ='
	Namei is the star of the system. 
	Its spectral class is K5V, and the star is about 4 billion years old. 
	The planets Oneia and Eisen orbit this star, along with:
'/>
<def id="nikki" content ='
	Nikki is a tidally locked moon of Oneia. 
	Like Oneia, Nikki is also inhabited. 
	Nikki is about 1/3 water by area.
	The entire world is constrolled by the Nikki Empire.
	The technology is roughly that of 1950s Earth.
'/>
<def id="nikkiempire" content ='
	The Nikki Empire has, in various, sometimes fractured forms, controlled Nikki for most of recorded history. 
	In the earliest recovered fragments of text, it seems they only stretched for a small fraction of the world. 
	A few hundred years after the recorded history, emperor Ntusint the Great conquered most of the remaining world, save for a few sparsely populated regions. 
	It was not until contemporary times the empire was able to extend its reach to these remotest of places. 
	The Empire is 800 Million people strong. 
	While the moon once spoke many languages, all of these have since been surplanted by the Nikki Language.
'/>
<def id="oneia" content ='
	Oneia is a planet orbiting Namei. 
	It orbits 0.32 au away and has a period of 75 earth days, or just over 61 Oneian days. 
	Oneia has one major moon, Nikki, along with some minor moons and a planetary ring. 
'/>
<def id="ora" content ='
	Ora is a continent of Oneia, north of Pankair. 
	It covers 0.4% of the planet&#39;s surface. 
	It is home to the Orans, a civilization notable for the invasion of Pankair. 
	Not much else is known about them to the Pankair...
'/>
<def id="pankair" content ='
	The most advanced continent of Oneia, and one of the only two to have iron-age civilizations, is Pankair. 
	The continent is so large it convers nearly 1% of the entire planetary surface. 
	Its mountainous terrain was the perfect spot for small city-states to crop up, and in the past few centuries, large empires formed. 
	The oldest of these city-states is Eremor, an arid city at the mouth of a river. 
	Over the past few decades and continuing still is the Oran invasion of the continent. 
	The current state of the once-prosperous continent is now chaos and instability. 
'/>
<def id="seter" content ='
	Seter is a major moon of Eisen. 
	It is just over eight Earth masses, about the size of Planet Nine. 
	Its orbital and rotation periods are three and one-sixth Earth days. 
	It is identical in composition and extremely similar in appearance to Eisen, but the banding is much less developed.
	The temperate light bands are by far the largest, taking perhaps as much as three-quarters the surface. 
	An interesting "chrome" effect happens in the darker bands when one views the outer limb of the atmosphere. 
	The effect is visible on Eisen too, but is far more subtle. It is thought to be caused by clouds of ice in the upper atmosphere. 
'/>
<def id="victoryisland" content ='
	Victory Island is located at the mouth of the Akkaha, in Eremor. 
	At its longest, it is 3 km long. 
	It is primarily notable as the site of Castle Eremor, Chiefs&#39; Convenience, and the Eremor College. 
	People travel to and from the island in boats, most of which are located in the northern docks. 
	The island itself is not nearly as inhabited as the mainland city since the island primarily contains administrators, upper-class, and apartments for their servants.
