	//The idea in this simple example mod is to add a few elements focused around hot sauce, because hot sauce is great and I use that stuff everywhere.
	
	//First we create a couple new resources :
	new G.Res({
		name:'hot pepper',
		desc:'[hot pepper]s are loaded with capsaicin and, depending on who you ask, may produce a pleasant burn when eaten.',
		icon:[0,0,'spicySheet'],
		turnToByContext:{'eat':{'health':0.01,'happiness':0.03},'decay':{'spoiled food':0.5}},//this basically translates to : "when eaten, generate some health and happiness; when rotting, turn into either nothing or some spoiled food"
		partOf:'food',
		category:'food',
	});
	new G.Res({
		name:'hot sauce',
		desc:'Made from [herb]s and the [hot pepper,Spiciest peppers], this [hot sauce] stays fresh for a while and will leave anyone panting and asking for more.',
		icon:[1,0,'spicySheet'],
		turnToByContext:{'eat':{'health':0.03,'happiness':0.1},'decay':{'hot sauce':0.95,'spoiled food':0.05}},//that last part makes hot sauce effectively have a 95% chance of simply not rotting (in effect, it decays into itself)
		partOf:'food',
		category:'food',
	});
	
	//Then we augment the base data to incorporate our new resources :
		//adding hot pepper as something that can be gathered from grass
	G.getDict('grass').res['gather']['hot pepper']=3;
		//adding a new mode to artisans so they can make hot sauce from hot peppers
	G.getDict('artisan').modes['hot sauce']={name:'Make hot sauce',desc:'Turn 3 [hot pepper]s and 3 [herb]s into 1 [hot sauce].',req:{'hot sauce preparing':true},use:{'knapped tools':1}};
		//adding a new effect to artisans that handles the actual hot sauce preparing and is only active when the unit has the mode "hot sauce"
	G.getDict('artisan').effects.push({type:'convert',from:{'hot pepper':3,'herb':3},into:{'hot sauce':1},every:3,mode:'hot sauce'});
	
	//Then we add a new technology which is required by the artisans to gain access to the "hot sauce" mode :
	new G.Tech({
		name:'hot sauce preparing',
		desc:'@[artisan]s can now produce [hot sauce] from [hot pepper]s and [herb]s//This special recipe allows a skilled craftsman to fully express the complex aromas present in hot peppers.',
		icon:[0,1,'spicySheet'],
		cost:{'insight':10},
		req:{'cooking':true},
	});
	
	//Finally, we add a trait that amplifies the benefits of consuming hot sauce; it will take on average 20 years to appear once the conditions (knowing the "Hot sauce preparing" tech) is fulfilled.
	new G.Trait({
		name:'hot sauce madness',
		desc:'@your people appreciate [hot sauce] twice as much and will be twice as happy from consuming it.',
		icon:[1,1,'spicySheet'],
		chance:20,
		req:{'hot sauce preparing':true},
		effects:[
			{type:'function',func:function(){G.getDict('hot sauce').turnToByContext['eat']['happiness']=0.2;}},//this is a custom function executed when we gain the trait
		],
	});
	
	//There are many other ways of adding and changing content; refer to /data.js, the default dataset, if you want to see how everything is done in the base game. Good luck!
