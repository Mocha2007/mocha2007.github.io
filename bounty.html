			<s>Pixel-style, art game.
			The goal of each level was to touch all the blocks, thereby lighting them up and revealing the whole image.
			I believe most of the level maps were circular in shape.
			Each level had different music.
			This brings me to the reason <i>why</i> I'm so interested in finding this game again...<br>
			<br>
			There was one level, a snow-themed level, which used the piece <i>Frost Waltz</i> by Kevin MacLeod.
			Due to the nature of his music, the piece has been featured in hundreds, if not thousands of games.
			Every time I've heard that song since, I always think of that level from that game.<br>
			<br>
			I specifically recall this being one of the first pieces I heard when music was added to KSP,
			and experiencing the same sensation then, thus dating the game to 2012 Sep 19 or earlier.
			Because of the publishing of the song, the game must have been released 2008 Nov 21 or later.
			It is quite likely I first played the game on ArmorGames, but it is probably also on Newgrounds.<br>
			<br>
			An exhaustive survey of every game published on AG using the Wayback Machine has excluded an AG release before 2009 Nov 10.</s><br>
			<br>
			An exhaustive survey of every game published on AG using the Wayback Machine has found the game!
			I have now added it to the <a href="recommend.html">recommended games list</a> - it's a real treat, and I highly recommend it!
			You can see a playthrough of the level in question <a href="https://youtu.be/V5TlHG-tapQ?t=647">here</a>.
			You can also listen to an interview with the creator at <cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190310025331/http://howtomurdertime.com/blog/2009/11/20/van-hemlock-episode-78/">Van Hemlock</a></cite>.
			In 2010 the developer went on to develop <cite><a href="https://www.rathergood.com/unnatural/">Unnatural Selection</a></cite>,
			and was working on three games called <cite>Fireflight</cite>, <cite>Sentinel</cite>, and <cite>Two</cite>.
			In 2011 he released <cite><a href="https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/38933/?lang=en&countrycode=US">Rocketstorm</a></cite> for BlackBerry.
			In 2012 he stopped posting on his blog <cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140913115906/http://lackofbanjos.com:80/">Lack of Banjos</a></cite>, which later ceased to exist in 2014.
			This seems to be the end of our story.

			Citybuilder game once available on yoyogames.
			Included a dyer ("vats"), quarry(?) or mine(?), warehouse, among other things.
			Isometric. Pixel-art style.
			Likely made during or before 2011.
			A couple years ago I found the title and a screenshot of the game.
			Since I never found a download link, I lost the title but still kept the screenshot above.

			UPDATE: (2019 Aug 31) I found the game. It was called <i>Tribal</i>, coded by <i>pick yer poison</i> in 2008.
			The developer wrote five games total in a one-year period from August 2008 to August 2009.
			Sadly, I have no further information... if you know this person, let me know!
