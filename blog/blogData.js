	I have been thinking about the weather recently.
	It has not snowed yet this winter here, although it did drop below freezing a few times.
	It rained this morning, and then stopped around noon.
	Then the rain picked up again a few hours later and contined into the evening.
	It has been in the 40s and 50s so far this week, as far as I recall.
	I wonder if I should add weather analysis tools to my to-do list...

	I was also reminded of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war today.
	I read <a href="https://time.com/6244330/russia-ukraine-war-nuclear-threat/">an article in Time</a> reiterating the looming nuclear threats.
	It appears little progress has been made from Ukraine in the past couple months, which would strengthen the likelihood of a stalemate.
	However, Ukraine did recapture Kherson a couple months ago, so I suppose the front line isn't totally frozen.

	@tags wikipedia
	Wikipedia recently redesigned their interface for the first time in over a decade.
	I have mixed feelings about it.
	If they removed the ridiculous amount of whitespace, I would say my overall impression would be positive.
	Unfortunately, the whitespace just kills it for me.
	Worse yet is that many actions that took a single click now take several.
	They said there would be a way for logged-out users to toggle the new interface,
	but initially the button did not appear at all, and now it only appears on wide enough monitors.
	There is also the minor issue of coordinates on location pages now weirdly mixing with the article body,
	but that's not <em>that</em> bad.
	The sole positive change is them moving the table of contents into the sidebar.
	On a sidenote, I am completely baffled as to how Wikipedia is the only major website to not even have considered a dark mode.
	Anyways, until and unless they fix the whitespace issues, I think I'll stick with the classic look.

	@tags math
	On a whim I decided to try to figure out the group of rotations of a tetrahedron.
	Obviously there are twelve orientations (4 faces * 3 sides per face),
	but I wasn't sure how to name them.
	I decided to arbitrarily name three axes (going from a vertex through the center of a face) A, B, C, and D,
	and to call a clockwise rotation along the axis "_<sub>1</sub>" and a counterclockwise rotation "_<sub>2</sub>".
	I also decided to name the identity rotation "0".
	Beforehand, I thought this would be everything,
	but after writing it out I realized that would only cover 9 rotations.
	I then decided to name the remaining rotations X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>,
	and X<sub>3</sub> in order of when I first encountered them.
	Interesting properties I found:
	<ol>
		<li>
			The rotations are not commutative.
			All combinations of different letters are counterexamples.
			eg. A<sub>1</sub>&middot;B<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>2</sub> but B<sub>1</sub>&middot;A<sub>1</sub> = D<sub>2</sub>.
			If the two operands have the same letter, they are commutative,
			and the result also has the same letter, or is 0.
		</li>
		<li>
			Rotation by the identity rotation is period-1 (obviously),
			rotation by a _<sub>n</sub> rotation is period-3,
			but rotation by X<sub>n</sub> is period-2 -
			ie. X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, and X<sub>3</sub> are their own inverses.
		</li>
		<li>
			_<sub>1</sub>&middot;_<sub>1</sub> = _<sub>2</sub>
		</li>
		<li>
			_<sub>2</sub>&middot;_<sub>2</sub> = _<sub>1</sub>
		</li>
		<li>
			_<sub>1</sub>&middot;_<sub>2</sub> <em>or</em> _<sub>2</sub>&middot;_<sub>1</sub> = X<sub>n</sub> <em>or</em> 0
		</li>
		<li>
			X<sub>n</sub>&middot;_<sub>m</sub> <em>or</em> _<sub>m</sub>&middot;X<sub>n</sub> = _<sub>m</sub>
		</li>
		<li>
			A generating set of the group is {A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>}.
			In fact, every set of two elements with different letters is a generating set.
			Intuitively it makes sense the minimal generating set would need two elements of different axes,
			since it is similar to geographic coordinates on a sphere.
		</li>
	</ol>
	Unfortunately I do not yet know the deeper reason behind some of these properties,
	but I will definitely keep thinking about them in the back of my mind.
	The period-3 rotations are and obviously must be rotations by 120&deg;,
	but the period-2 rotations are less clear when I try to visualize them.
	Since they are period-2, I <em>suppose</em> they are rotations by 180&deg; (at least, that is my only rationalization),
	but I have some doubt about that and perhaps there is some other weird movement going on instead.

	I was worried it wouldn't be physically possible, but it turned out to be easy,
	and required no stretching or contortion of the paper whatsoever,
	but did require it to stretch into the third dimension in parts.
	When holding it, the joints bend and contort weirdly.
	The closest thing I can compare it to is a planar Jacob's ladder.

	I added several new words (mostly fruit) to Eremoran today, including the 900th word - <em>eresoni</em> "rambutan".
	Afterwards, I was curious as to the average number of words added per day:
	it turns out to have been about 0.46 words per day so far.
	I decided that, since I want that number to be 1 word per day,
	I should add at least 4-5 new words per day for the rest of the year,
	so that by the end of the year that number should reach one word per day average.
	Let's see if I can actually stick to this goal - lol.

	@tags math
	I've long known about the old trick of "cancelling out" the sixes in 16/64 to get the correct simplification of 1/4,
	but I wondered to myself if there were other fractions like that.
	Excluding trivial forms like 11/11, etc., I was able to construct a proof -
	to my level of satisfaction, at least -
	that there are exactly four non-trivial solutions:
	<ul>
		<li>19/95 &rarr; 1/5</li>
		<li>49/98 &rarr; 4/8</li>
		<li>16/64 &rarr; 1/4</li>
		<li>26/65 &rarr; 2/5</li>
	</ul>
	Unfortunately, I realized my little trick for this wouldn't work for 3-digit fractions -
	or, if it can, I couldn't figure it out.
	@p
	@tags math js
	So instead, I wrote a script to find these - and as it turns out, there are dozens and dozens of non-trivial solutions (my program found 220, but there may be others).
	One such solution is 334/835 &rarr; 34/85.
	But interestingly enough, all four of the previous solutions have one (and, as far as I can tell, <em>only</em> one) corresponding three-digit solution:
	<ul>
		<li>199/995 &rarr; 19/95</li>
		<li>499/998 &rarr; 49/98</li>
		<li>166/664 &rarr; 16/64</li>
		<li>266/665 &rarr; 26/65</li>
	</ul>
	Although I tried to use as many clever tricks to make computation as fast as possible,
	I ended up giving up trying to find a clever algorithm to find all the factors of a number.
	Yet another script to add to my useless library of hundreds of single-use scripts... lol.

	@tags eremoran math
	I added several new math terms to Eremoran today.
	I was curious to see how other languages translate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid">platonic solids</a>,
	but disappointingly they are all essentially English calques.
	I, however, have another idea: instead of classifying polygons by their faces,
	what about their vertices?
	And so now, in Eremoran, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogonal_figure">isogonal polyhedra</a> are defined by their vertex behavior.
	For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_icosahedron">icosahedron</a> is <em>hanuzkumkimÃ´m</em> -
	in other words "triangles, five times [around the vertex]".
	This is sufficient to uniquely identify it as an icosahedron.
	But furthermore, this isn't just some random property of the polyhedron -
	if you turn the solid so you face a vertex, this is <em>exactly what you see</em> -
	five triangles around a single point.
	I imagine, with the level of technology available,
	it would be rather challenging to produce many of these solids -
	practically relegating them to drawings or the imagination, where this is all that would be visible!
	Theoretically, this could also be extended to non-platonic solids:
	for example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicuboctahedron">rhombicuboctahedron</a> could be a <em>kumkimÃ´kumkuzbabzimÃ´m</em>.
	As a pleasant surprise, the Eremoran terms tend to use roughly the same amount of syllables as in English,
	so I don't have to worry about these being unrealistically unwieldy.

	I've recently been into Factorio again, and I realized something interesting.
	There are few renewable resources, but one of the ones that is? Crude oil.
	Yes, crude oil is renewable in factorio.
	Pumpjacks bottom out at 2 crude oil per second, and never deplete.
	This means oil products are among the handful of truly renewable resources:
	<ul>
		<li>Energy, Water, Crude Oil</li>
		<li>Heavy Oil, Light Oil, Petroleum Gas</li>
		<li>Steam</li>
		<li>Sulfur</li>
		<li>Lubricant</li>
		<li>Solid Fuel</li>
		<li>Rocket Fuel</li>
	</ul>
	However, in order to acquire any of these,
	you will need a <em>small</em> quanitity of non-renewables to kickstart production,
	but after that, everything is automatic.
	A small base focused on crude oil extraction,
	with flamethrowers and laser turrets,
	could run indefinitely without maintenance.

	@title Exploring the Generalized Collatz Problem
	@date 1677598875664
	@p
	@tags math js
	This morning I wondered what would happen if you replaced the coefficients in the
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz problem</a> with others.
	So I wrote a quick program in JS to allow me to experiment with this.
	@p
	@tags math
	After some experimenting, I came across a really interesting variant:
	<ul>
		<li>Modulus: 5</li>
		<li>Formula for remainders:
		<ol>
			<li value="0">n &rarr; n/5</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 2n + 3</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 3n + 4</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 4n + 3</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 6n + 1</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	This rule has four different positive cycles:
	<ul>
		<li>1 &harr; 5</li>
		<li>2 &harr; 10</li>
		<li>3 &harr; 15</li>
		<li>19 &rarr; 115 &rarr; 23 &rarr; 95 &rarr; 19</li>
	</ul>
	The distribution of which numbers falls into the cycles is interesting.
	Although most fall into the 1 cycle, quite a few fall into the 19 cycle.
	And although there are many stretches of integers that fall only into the 1 cycle,
	there are also a few stretches of integers which never fall into the 1 cycle, but instead fall into one of the others.
	For example, the range 90 to 95 inclusive all falls into 3 or 19,
	but that range is immediately preceded by a range of seven integers that all converge to 1.
	@p
	@tags math
	At this point you might just assume in all rules the majority of positive integers converge to 1.
	However, this is far from the truth. Consider:
	<ul>
		<li>Modulus: 3</li>
		<li>Formula for remainders:
		<ol>
			<li value="0">n &rarr; n/3</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 4n + 2</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 4n + 1</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	This rule has two different positive cycles:
	<ul>
		<li>1 &rarr; 6 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 9 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 1</li>
		<li>7 &rarr; 30 &rarr; 10 &rarr; 42 &rarr; 14 &rarr; 57 &rarr;
		19 &rarr; 78 &rarr; 26 &rarr; 105 &rarr; 35 &rarr; 141 &rarr;
		47 &rarr; 189 &rarr; 63 &rarr; 21 &rarr; 7</li>
	</ul>
	The majority of positive integers falls into the latter cycle.
	In fact, the fraction that do seems to only increase with the range of integers considered.
	The first four positive integers all fall into the first cycle,
	5/8 of the first eight do,
	8/16 of the first sixteen do,
	12/32 of the first thirty-two do,
	and 17/64 of the first sixty-four do.
	@p
	@tags math
	There is also this interesting rule that has three cycles and some paths I suspect go to infinity:
	<ul>
		<li>Modulus: 2</li>
		<li>Formula for remainders:
		<ol>
			<li value="0">n &rarr; n/2</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 5n + 1</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	Cycles:
	<ul>
		<li>1 &rarr; 6 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 16 &rarr; 8 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 1</li>
		<li>13 &rarr; 66 &rarr; 33 &rarr; 166 &rarr; 83 &rarr; 416 &rarr; 208 &rarr; 104 &rarr; 52 &rarr; 26 &rarr; 13</li>
		<li>17 &rarr; 86 &rarr; 43 &rarr; 216 &rarr; 108 &rarr; 54 &rarr; 27 &rarr; 136 &rarr; 68 &rarr; 34 &rarr; 17</li>
		<li>7 &rarr; ... &rarr; &infin;</li>
		<li>21 &rarr; ... &rarr; &infin; (this appears to be distinct from the above path)</li>
		<li>??? Possibly others ??? </li>
	</ul>
	There seems to be a pattern with the 7 path - the remainder modulo 10 of terms is 8, then 9, then 6,
	then one pair of 3-6. The next time around, it becomes two pairs of 3-6. Then three, then four...
	The numbers only seem to get bigger.

	@title C# Binge
	@date 1678111176704
	@p
	@tags dev c#
	Over the weekend I wrote a quick unit conversion utility in C#,
	and also created a calendar system based on the Metonic cycle with an application to convert
	between that system and the Gregorian calendar.
	@p
	@tags calendar
	The system is as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Normal years have twelve months of 29 or 30 days.</li>
		<li>Even-indexed months (starting with 0) have 30 days, while odd-indexed months have 29.</li>
		<li>If the year mod 19 mod 4 is 0, the second month (index 1) has a leap day, totalling 30 days instead of 29.</li>
		<li>If the year mod 19 mod 3 is 0, there is a leap month at the end of the year.</li>
	</ul>
	This means each year has 354, 355, 384, or 385 days in a cycle repeating only every 19 years,
	with a cycle totalling 6940 days.
	I suppose to make it more precise, the leap day could have similar rules
	to how the Gregorian calendar doesn't have leap years when the year mod 400 is 100, 200, or 300.
	If so, our target would be to have an accuracy similar to the Gregorian calendar - an error of about one day per 3030 years.
	Since 19 tropical years is 6939.602 days,
	and since 235 synodic months is 6939.689 days,
	perhaps we could split the difference and say we're targetting about ~6939.6455.
	Well, that's pretty close to 6939.6r,
	so perhaps we can say that in the first 19-year cycle of three, the leap day is ignored.
	That would mean, in the same 3030-year period,
	this calendar would lose about 10.3 days wrt. the tropical year,
	and an error of about 3.6 days wrt. the synodic month.
	This is a bit more than I'd like,
	but we have to remember that no matter what we set the average cycle length to,
	the total error between the two is going to add to about 13.9 days.
	We could say "use 5 out of 8 cycles" (the next best), or 7 out of 11 cycles,
	9 out of 14, etc., but ultimately the error for one of them will be at least 7 days when rounded.
	Therefore, using the three-cycle rule seems sufficient - certainly better than a 63 day error without!

	@title Uranian Moon Names
	@date 1678819743211
	@p
	@tags uranus
	Remembering that Uranian moons are named after characters of Shakespearean plays
	and characters in Alexander Pope's <cite>The Rape of the Lock</cite>,
	I set about trying to find what the most interesting or humorous potential moon names would be,
	and found eleven of interest:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Dick</strong> - named after the character <em>Dick the Butcher</em> in <cite>Henry VI, Part 2</cite>,
			famous for the line <q>Let's kill all the lawyers</q>.</li>
		<li><strong>Jupiter</strong> - who has a single line in <cite>Cymbeline</cite>, Act V, Scene IV</li>
		<li><strong>Moth</strong> - one of two characters from <cite>Love's Labour's Lost</cite> or <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite></li>
		<li><strong>Mustardseed</strong> - a fairy in <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite></li>
		<li><strong>Orlando</strong> - of <cite>As You Like It</cite></li>
		<li><strong>Paris</strong> - characters of this name appear in three of Shakespeare's plays</li>
		<li><strong>Pinch</strong> - doctor in <cite>The Comedy of Errors</cite></li>
		<li><strong>Quickly</strong> - appears in four of Shakespeare's plays</li>
		<li><strong>Regan</strong> - of <cite>King Lear</cite></li>
		<li><strong>Rugby</strong> - servant to Caius in <cite>The Merry Wives of Windsor</cite></li>
		<li><strong>Silence</strong> - name of a judge who appears in Acts III and V of <cite>Henry IV, Part 2</cite></li>
	</ul>
	I doubt <em>Jupiter</em> would fly, but I wonder if the rest would be found acceptable by the IAU.
	Dick and Paris are already the names of asteroids, so that would be another hinderance.

	It has been six weeks since I started adding new vocab.
	In that time, I have added 265 words,

	I also had to tweak the Eremoran calendar yesterday,
	since I realized the axial precession rate for Oneia was much more than I anticipated -
	one complete precession would occur about once every 320 earth years,
	leading to a tropical year substantially shorter than a sideral year.
	So now leap days are determined as follows: if the year is odd or divisible by fifty, it is a leap year.

	@title Math behind a Conscript
	@date 1680100237142
	@p
	@tags conlang math
	I recently read a <a href="https://footballbatsandmore.wordpress.com/">conlang blog</a>
	with an interesting writing system (Omyatloko).
	It appears to comprise glyphs of a certain form -
	taking a 3 by 3 square grid of vertices and drawing edges between some of the orthogonal vertices.
	It reminds me of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Genji_chapter_symbols_groupings_of_5_elements.svg">Genji chapter symbols</a>.
	I do not know if its creator calculated the number of possible glyphs,
	but I certainly have: since there are 12 vertices, there must be 2<sup>12</sup> = 4096 possible glyphs,
	or 1024 glyphs excluding rotations, or 512 excluding rotations and reflections.
	But more generally, for a glyph grid of size n:
	<ul>
		<li>Vertices: n<sup>2</sup></li>
		<li>Edges: 2n(n-1)</li>
		<li>Unique Glyphs: 2<sup>2n(n-1)</sup></li>
		<li>Unique Glyphs (excl. rotations): 2<sup>2n(n-1)-2</sup></li>
		<li>Unique Glyphs (excl. rotations and reflections): 2<sup>2n(n-1)-3</sup></li>
	</ul>
	@p
	The author has devised a method of organizing the glyphs by radical;
	however, an alternative could be to instead convert the state (on/off) of all the edges to binary, and then to decimal.
	For example, this glyph:
	<img src="https://imgur.com/cGHp4kd.png">
	could be transcribed (edges from top to bottom, left to right) 111010010000<sub>2</sub>, or 3728<sub>10</sub>.
	This system has the added bonus that, if you reverse the binary, you get the 180&deg; rotation of that glyph.
	@p
	The grammar document seems to imply about 1200 of these have already been assigned -
	If that is the case, there must be glyphs that are identical under rotation.
	Indeed, hama, kasu, yama, and tsila are one such group.
	@p
	There is one caveat: the bit about rotations is only true for blocky fonts.
	In calligraphy, stroke order would subtly change the appearance of, eg.,
	a <em>hama</em> glyph versus a rotated <em>kasu</em> glyph.
	@p
	Not only is this writing system aesthetic,
	It is also easy to write a script to render glyphs (at least, in a blocky form).
	I'm tempted to perhaps borrow this idea, perhaps in a modified form... :^)

	@date 1680200717469
	@p
	@tags conlang math
	I realized the figures I gave for rotationally/reflectionally unique glyphs I give
	<a href="blog.html?i=21#s0">here</a> are actually lower bounds that do not account for symmetrical glyphs.
	The actual values are 1044 and 570, instead of 1024 and 512.
	376 glyphs have two symmetries, 20 have four, and 4 have all eight.
	@p
	@tags math
	570 though is still much higher than the figure for a 2x2 square -
	excluding symmetries, there would only by 5 unique glyphs (6 including the empty glyph).
	@p
	@tags english orthography
	Anyways, I used the script I wrote to compute these figures to try to develop the "ultimate" English orthography.
	One with completely distinct glyphs, with difficulty of writing the glyphs proportional to their phonemic frequency
	(which I use <a href="https://cmloegcmluin.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/relative-frequencies-of-english-phonemes/">this</a> as a source for).

	@date 1688672359277
	@p
	@tags language
	Here I have compiled a list of terms that, in my opinion, don't make sense.
	I am deliberately excluding well-documented misnomers like "french dip" (a Californian invention),
	metaphors like "purple state" (which is not a state aligning to a hypothetical "purple party", but rather a "neutral" state),
	metonyms of any sort, such as "fly fishing" (which involves no real flies, but is named because it mimics flies),
	redundant formations like "ATM machine",
	or illogical syntax, such as the countable use of "DLC".
	Note also that I am not prescribing any linguistic change,
	but merely pointing out some counterintuitive word formations,
	along with providing hypothetical "logical" alternatives.
	<ol>
		<li><b>antisemitism</b> - is generally only applied to jews, not to any other semitic group.
		Should therefore be "antijudaism".</li>
		<li><b>caucasian</b> - generally applied to people and cultures with no ties to the Caucasus.
		Ironically, many Caucasians would not be considered caucasian by American standards.
		The common synonym "white" is (slightly) more logical,
		although ideally one would avoid this outdated and arbitrary racial classification system entirely.</li>
		<li>(math) <b>closed & open</b> - unlike in literally any other context, in math, these are not mutually exclusive.
		Unfortunately, there are no obvious replacements - perhaps "limit-containing" and "limit-bounded", respectively?</li>
		<li><b>copyright</b> - on its surface, appears to indicate one's right to copy.
		In actuality, it is the opposite.
		"Intellectual property rights" or the less obvious but shorter "uncopiability" may be suitable alternatives.</li>
		<li>(American politics) <b>democrat & republican</b> - if you know nothing of American politics, you would assume
		democrats are anti-republic and pro-democracy, and republicans are ant-democracy and pro-republic.
		Snide comments aside, both largely support the continuance of the current system of power investiture (ie., a democratic republic).
		Many other countries use the more logical naming of "liberal" and "conservative", respectively, for similar parties,
		although "liberal" has its own problems.
		If it were up to me, though, I would either choose the existing "left-right" terminology,
		or invent a new meaning for "evolutionary" or "mutational" to contrast with "conservative".
		Don't even get me started on the backwards colors...</li>
		<li><b>preferred pronoun</b> - an unfortunate continuance of the same trivializing anti-queer attitudes that spawned terms like "sexual preference".
		Thankfully, the simple "pronoun" alone is already gaining ground without any prescriptivist intervention.
		If further specificity is somehow required, perhaps "identifying pronoun" would be a good fit.</li>
		<li><b>quiet quitting</b> - not even remotely quitting. It is quiet, though. A better term might be "jaded compliance".</li>
		<li><b>social distancing</b> - on the surface, appears to contrast with physical distancing - yet the two are one and the same.
		Perhaps a better alternative would be something like "hygienic distancing".</li>
	</ol>
	I don't see these talked about often. I guess most folks just take these terms for granted.
