	I have been thinking about the weather recently.
	It has not snowed yet this winter here, although it did drop below freezing a few times.
	It rained this morning, and then stopped around noon.
	Then the rain picked up again a few hours later and contined into the evening.
	It has been in the 40s and 50s so far this week, as far as I recall.
	I wonder if I should add weather analysis tools to my to-do list...

	I was also reminded of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war today.
	I read <a href="https://time.com/6244330/russia-ukraine-war-nuclear-threat/">an article in Time</a> reiterating the looming nuclear threats.
	It appears little progress has been made from Ukraine in the past couple months, which would strengthen the likelihood of a stalemate.
	However, Ukraine did recapture Kherson a couple months ago, so I suppose the front line isn't totally frozen.

	@tags wikipedia
	Wikipedia recently redesigned their interface for the first time in over a decade.
	I have mixed feelings about it.
	If they removed the ridiculous amount of whitespace, I would say my overall impression would be positive.
	Unfortunately, the whitespace just kills it for me.
	Worse yet is that many actions that took a single click now take several.
	They said there would be a way for logged-out users to toggle the new interface,
	but initially the button did not appear at all, and now it only appears on wide enough monitors.
	There is also the minor issue of coordinates on location pages now weirdly mixing with the article body,
	but that's not <em>that</em> bad.
	The sole positive change is them moving the table of contents into the sidebar.
	On a sidenote, I am completely baffled as to how Wikipedia is the only major website to not even have considered a dark mode.
	Anyways, until and unless they fix the whitespace issues, I think I'll stick with the classic look.

	@tags math
	On a whim I decided to try to figure out the group of rotations of a tetrahedron.
	Obviously there are twelve orientations (4 faces * 3 sides per face),
	but I wasn't sure how to name them.
	I decided to arbitrarily name three axes (going from a vertex through the center of a face) A, B, C, and D,
	and to call a clockwise rotation along the axis "_<sub>1</sub>" and a counterclockwise rotation "_<sub>2</sub>".
	I also decided to name the identity rotation "0".
	Beforehand, I thought this would be everything,
	but after writing it out I realized that would only cover 9 rotations.
	I then decided to name the remaining rotations X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>,
	and X<sub>3</sub> in order of when I first encountered them.
	Interesting properties I found:
	<ol>
		<li>
			The rotations are not commutative.
			All combinations of different letters are counterexamples.
			eg. A<sub>1</sub>&middot;B<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>2</sub> but B<sub>1</sub>&middot;A<sub>1</sub> = D<sub>2</sub>.
			If the two operands have the same letter, they are commutative,
			and the result also has the same letter, or is 0.
		</li>
		<li>
			Rotation by the identity rotation is period-1 (obviously),
			rotation by a _<sub>n</sub> rotation is period-3,
			but rotation by X<sub>n</sub> is period-2 -
			ie. X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, and X<sub>3</sub> are their own inverses.
		</li>
		<li>
			_<sub>1</sub>&middot;_<sub>1</sub> = _<sub>2</sub>
		</li>
		<li>
			_<sub>2</sub>&middot;_<sub>2</sub> = _<sub>1</sub>
		</li>
		<li>
			_<sub>1</sub>&middot;_<sub>2</sub> <em>or</em> _<sub>2</sub>&middot;_<sub>1</sub> = X<sub>n</sub> <em>or</em> 0
		</li>
		<li>
			X<sub>n</sub>&middot;_<sub>m</sub> <em>or</em> _<sub>m</sub>&middot;X<sub>n</sub> = _<sub>m</sub>
		</li>
		<li>
			A generating set of the group is {A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>}.
			In fact, every set of two elements with different letters is a generating set.
			Intuitively it makes sense the minimal generating set would need two elements of different axes,
			since it is similar to geographic coordinates on a sphere.
		</li>
	</ol>
	Unfortunately I do not yet know the deeper reason behind some of these properties,
	but I will definitely keep thinking about them in the back of my mind.
	The period-3 rotations are and obviously must be rotations by 120&deg;,
	but the period-2 rotations are less clear when I try to visualize them.
	Since they are period-2, I <em>suppose</em> they are rotations by 180&deg; (at least, that is my only rationalization),
	but I have some doubt about that and perhaps there is some other weird movement going on instead.

	I was worried it wouldn't be physically possible, but it turned out to be easy,
	and required no stretching or contortion of the paper whatsoever,
	but did require it to stretch into the third dimension in parts.
	When holding it, the joints bend and contort weirdly.
	The closest thing I can compare it to is a planar Jacob's ladder.

	I added several new words (mostly fruit) to Eremoran today, including the 900th word - <em>eresoni</em> "rambutan".
	Afterwards, I was curious as to the average number of words added per day:
	it turns out to have been about 0.46 words per day so far.
	I decided that, since I want that number to be 1 word per day,
	I should add at least 4-5 new words per day for the rest of the year,
	so that by the end of the year that number should reach one word per day average.
	Let's see if I can actually stick to this goal - lol.

	@tags math
	I've long known about the old trick of "cancelling out" the sixes in 16/64 to get the correct simplification of 1/4,
	but I wondered to myself if there were other fractions like that.
	Excluding trivial forms like 11/11, etc., I was able to construct a proof -
	to my level of satisfaction, at least -
	that there are exactly four non-trivial solutions:
	<ul>
		<li>19/95 &rarr; 1/5</li>
		<li>49/98 &rarr; 4/8</li>
		<li>16/64 &rarr; 1/4</li>
		<li>26/65 &rarr; 2/5</li>
	</ul>
	Unfortunately, I realized my little trick for this wouldn't work for 3-digit fractions -
	or, if it can, I couldn't figure it out.
	@p
	@tags math js
	So instead, I wrote a script to find these - and as it turns out, there are dozens and dozens of non-trivial solutions (my program found 220, but there may be others).
	One such solution is 334/835 &rarr; 34/85.
	But interestingly enough, all four of the previous solutions have one (and, as far as I can tell, <em>only</em> one) corresponding three-digit solution:
	<ul>
		<li>199/995 &rarr; 19/95</li>
		<li>499/998 &rarr; 49/98</li>
		<li>166/664 &rarr; 16/64</li>
		<li>266/665 &rarr; 26/65</li>
	</ul>
	Although I tried to use as many clever tricks to make computation as fast as possible,
	I ended up giving up trying to find a clever algorithm to find all the factors of a number.
	Yet another script to add to my useless library of hundreds of single-use scripts... lol.

	@tags eremoran math
	I added several new math terms to Eremoran today.
	I was curious to see how other languages translate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid">platonic solids</a>,
	but disappointingly they are all essentially English calques.
	I, however, have another idea: instead of classifying polygons by their faces,
	what about their vertices?
	And so now, in Eremoran, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogonal_figure">isogonal polyhedra</a> are defined by their vertex behavior.
	For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_icosahedron">icosahedron</a> is <em>hanuzkumkimÃ´m</em> -
	in other words "triangles, five times [around the vertex]".
	This is sufficient to uniquely identify it as an icosahedron.
	But furthermore, this isn't just some random property of the polyhedron -
	if you turn the solid so you face a vertex, this is <em>exactly what you see</em> -
	five triangles around a single point.
	I imagine, with the level of technology available,
	it would be rather challenging to produce many of these solids -
	practically relegating them to drawings or the imagination, where this is all that would be visible!
	Theoretically, this could also be extended to non-platonic solids:
	for example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicuboctahedron">rhombicuboctahedron</a> could be a <em>kumkimÃ´kumkuzbabzimÃ´m</em>.
	As a pleasant surprise, the Eremoran terms tend to use roughly the same amount of syllables as in English,
	so I don't have to worry about these being unrealistically unwieldy.

	I've recently been into Factorio again, and I realized something interesting.
	There are few renewable resources, but one of the ones that is? Crude oil.
	Yes, crude oil is renewable in factorio.
	Pumpjacks bottom out at 2 crude oil per second, and never deplete.
	This means oil products are among the handful of truly renewable resources:
	<ul>
		<li>Energy, Water, Crude Oil</li>
		<li>Heavy Oil, Light Oil, Petroleum Gas</li>
		<li>Steam</li>
		<li>Sulfur</li>
		<li>Lubricant</li>
		<li>Solid Fuel</li>
		<li>Rocket Fuel</li>
	</ul>
	However, in order to acquire any of these,
	you will need a <em>small</em> quanitity of non-renewables to kickstart production,
	but after that, everything is automatic.
	A small base focused on crude oil extraction,
	with flamethrowers and laser turrets,
	could run indefinitely without maintenance.

	@title Exploring the Generalized Collatz Problem
	@date 1677598875664
	@p
	@tags math js
	This morning I wondered what would happen if you replaced the coefficients in the
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz problem</a> with others.
	So I wrote a quick program in JS to allow me to experiment with this.
	@p
	@tags math
	After some experimenting, I came across a really interesting variant:
	<ul>
		<li>Modulus: 5</li>
		<li>Formula for remainders:
		<ol>
			<li value="0">n &rarr; n/5</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 2n + 3</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 3n + 4</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 4n + 3</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 6n + 1</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	This rule has four different positive cycles:
	<ul>
		<li>1 &harr; 5</li>
		<li>2 &harr; 10</li>
		<li>3 &harr; 15</li>
		<li>19 &rarr; 115 &rarr; 23 &rarr; 95 &rarr; 19</li>
	</ul>
	The distribution of which numbers falls into the cycles is interesting.
	Although most fall into the 1 cycle, quite a few fall into the 19 cycle.
	And although there are many stretches of integers that fall only into the 1 cycle,
	there are also a few stretches of integers which never fall into the 1 cycle, but instead fall into one of the others.
	For example, the range 90 to 95 inclusive all falls into 3 or 19,
	but that range is immediately preceded by a range of seven integers that all converge to 1.
	@p
	@tags math
	At this point you might just assume in all rules the majority of positive integers converge to 1.
	However, this is far from the truth. Consider:
	<ul>
		<li>Modulus: 3</li>
		<li>Formula for remainders:
		<ol>
			<li value="0">n &rarr; n/3</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 4n + 2</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 4n + 1</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	This rule has two different positive cycles:
	<ul>
		<li>1 &rarr; 6 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 9 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 1</li>
		<li>7 &rarr; 30 &rarr; 10 &rarr; 42 &rarr; 14 &rarr; 57 &rarr;
		19 &rarr; 78 &rarr; 26 &rarr; 105 &rarr; 35 &rarr; 141 &rarr;
		47 &rarr; 189 &rarr; 63 &rarr; 21 &rarr; 7</li>
	</ul>
	The majority of positive integers falls into the latter cycle.
	In fact, the fraction that do seems to only increase with the range of integers considered.
	The first four positive integers all fall into the first cycle,
	5/8 of the first eight do,
	8/16 of the first sixteen do,
	12/32 of the first thirty-two do,
	and 17/64 of the first sixty-four do.
	@p
	@tags math
	There is also this interesting rule that has three cycles and some paths I suspect go to infinity:
	<ul>
		<li>Modulus: 2</li>
		<li>Formula for remainders:
		<ol>
			<li value="0">n &rarr; n/2</li>
			<li>n &rarr; 5n + 1</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	Cycles:
	<ul>
		<li>1 &rarr; 6 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 16 &rarr; 8 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 1</li>
		<li>13 &rarr; 66 &rarr; 33 &rarr; 166 &rarr; 83 &rarr; 416 &rarr; 208 &rarr; 104 &rarr; 52 &rarr; 26 &rarr; 13</li>
		<li>17 &rarr; 86 &rarr; 43 &rarr; 216 &rarr; 108 &rarr; 54 &rarr; 27 &rarr; 136 &rarr; 68 &rarr; 34 &rarr; 17</li>
		<li>7 &rarr; ... &rarr; &infin;</li>
		<li>21 &rarr; ... &rarr; &infin; (this appears to be distinct from the above path)</li>
		<li>??? Possibly others ??? </li>
	</ul>
	There seems to be a pattern with the 7 path - the remainder modulo 10 of terms is 8, then 9, then 6,
	then one pair of 3-6. The next time around, it becomes two pairs of 3-6. Then three, then four...
	The numbers only seem to get bigger.

	@title C# Binge
	@date 1678111176704
	@p
	@tags dev c#
	Over the weekend I wrote a quick unit conversion utility in C#,
	and also created a calendar system based on the Metonic cycle with an application to convert
	between that system and the Gregorian calendar.
	@p
	@tags calendar
	The system is as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Normal years have twelve months of 29 or 30 days.</li>
		<li>Even-indexed months (starting with 0) have 30 days, while odd-indexed months have 29.</li>
		<li>If the year mod 19 mod 4 is 0, the second month (index 1) has a leap day, totalling 30 days instead of 29.</li>
		<li>If the year mod 19 mod 3 is 0, there is a leap month at the end of the year.</li>
	</ul>
	This means each year has 354, 355, 384, or 385 days in a cycle repeating only every 19 years,
	with a cycle totalling 6940 days.
	I suppose to make it more precise, the leap day could have similar rules
	to how the Gregorian calendar doesn't have leap years when the year mod 400 is 100, 200, or 300.
	If so, our target would be to have an accuracy similar to the Gregorian calendar - an error of about one day per 3030 years.
	Since 19 tropical years is 6939.602 days,
	and since 235 synodic months is 6939.689 days,
	perhaps we could split the difference and say we're targetting about ~6939.6455.
	Well, that's pretty close to 6939.6r,
	so perhaps we can say that in the first 19-year cycle of three, the leap day is ignored.
	That would mean, in the same 3030-year period,
	this calendar would lose about 10.3 days wrt. the tropical year,
	and an error of about 3.6 days wrt. the synodic month.
	This is a bit more than I'd like,
	but we have to remember that no matter what we set the average cycle length to,
	the total error between the two is going to add to about 13.9 days.
	We could say "use 5 out of 8 cycles" (the next best), or 7 out of 11 cycles,
	9 out of 14, etc., but ultimately the error for one of them will be at least 7 days when rounded.
	Therefore, using the three-cycle rule seems sufficient - certainly better than a 63 day error without!

	Remembering that Uranian moons are named after characters of Shakespearean plays
	and characters in Alexander Pope's <cite>The Rape of the Lock</cite>,
	I set about trying to find what the most interesting or humorous potential moon names would be,
	and found eleven of interest:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Dick</strong> - named after the character <em>Dick the Butcher</em> in <cite>Henry VI, Part 2</cite>,
			famous for the line <q>Let's kill all the lawyers</q>.</li>
		<li><strong>Jupiter</strong> - who has a single line in <cite>Cymbeline</cite>, Act V, Scene IV</li>
		<li><strong>Moth</strong> - one of two characters from <cite>Love's Labour's Lost</cite> or <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite></li>
		<li><strong>Mustardseed</strong> - a fairy in <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite></li>
		<li><strong>Orlando</strong> - of <cite>As You Like It</cite></li>
		<li><strong>Paris</strong> - characters of this name appear in three of Shakespeare's plays</li>
		<li><strong>Pinch</strong> - doctor in <cite>The Comedy of Errors</cite></li>
		<li><strong>Quickly</strong> - appears in four of Shakespeare's plays</li>
		<li><strong>Regan</strong> - of <cite>King Lear</cite></li>
		<li><strong>Rugby</strong> - servant to Caius in <cite>The Merry Wives of Windsor</cite></li>
		<li><strong>Silence</strong> - name of a judge who appears in Acts III and V of <cite>Henry IV, Part 2</cite></li>
	</ul>
	I doubt <em>Jupiter</em> would fly, but I wonder if the rest would be found acceptable by the IAU.
	Dick and Paris are already the names of asteroids, so that would be another hinderance.

	@date 1680100237142
	@p
	@tags conlang math
	I recently read a <a href="https://footballbatsandmore.wordpress.com/">conlang blog</a>
	with an interesting writing system (Omyatloko).
	It appears to comprise glyphs of a certain form -
	taking a 3 by 3 square grid of vertices and drawing edges between some of the orthogonal vertices.
	It reminds me of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Genji_chapter_symbols_groupings_of_5_elements.svg">Genji chapter symbols</a>.
	I do not know if its creator calculated the number of possible glyphs,
	but I certainly have: since there are 12 vertices, there must be 2<sup>12</sup> = 4096 possible glyphs,
	or 1024 glyphs excluding rotations, or 512 excluding rotations and reflections.
	But more generally, for a glyph grid of size n:
	<ul>
		<li>Vertices: n<sup>2</sup></li>
		<li>Edges: 2n(n-1)</li>
		<li>Unique Glyphs: 2<sup>2n(n-1)</sup></li>
		<li>Unique Glyphs (excl. rotations): 2<sup>2n(n-1)-2</sup></li>
		<li>Unique Glyphs (excl. rotations and reflections): 2<sup>2n(n-1)-3</sup></li>
	</ul>
	@p
	The author has devised a method of organizing the glyphs by radical;
	however, an alternative could be to instead convert the state (on/off) of all the edges to binary, and then to decimal.
	For example, this glyph:
	<img src="https://imgur.com/cGHp4kd.png">
	could be transcribed (edges from top to bottom, left to right) 111010010000<sub>2</sub>, or 3728<sub>10</sub>.
	This system has the added bonus that, if you reverse the binary, you get the 180&deg; rotation of that glyph.
	@p
	The grammar document seems to imply about 1200 of these have already been assigned -
	If that is the case, there must be glyphs that are identical under rotation.
	Indeed, hama, kasu, yama, and tsila are one such group.
	@p
	There is one caveat: the bit about rotations is only true for blocky fonts.
	In calligraphy, stroke order would subtly change the appearance of, eg.,
	a <em>hama</em> glyph versus a rotated <em>kasu</em> glyph.
	@p
	Not only is this writing system aesthetic,
	It is also easy to write a script to render glyphs (at least, in a blocky form).
	I'm tempted to perhaps borrow this idea, perhaps in a modified form... :^)

	I realized the figures I gave for rotationally/reflectionally unique glyphs I give
	<a href="blog.html?i=21#s0">here</a> are actually lower bounds that do not account for symmetrical glyphs.
	The actual values are 1044 and 570, instead of 1024 and 512.
	376 glyphs have two symmetries, 20 have four, and 4 have all eight.

	570 though is still much higher than the figure for a 2x2 square -
	excluding symmetries, there would only by 5 unique glyphs (6 including the empty glyph).

	Anyways, I used the script I wrote to compute these figures to try to develop the "ultimate" English orthography.

	Here I have compiled a list of terms that, in my opinion, don't make sense.
	I am deliberately excluding well-documented misnomers like "french dip" (a Californian invention),
	metaphors like "purple state" (which is not a state aligning to a hypothetical "purple party", but rather a "neutral" state),
	metonyms of any sort, such as "fly fishing" (which involves no real flies, but is named because it mimics flies),
	redundant formations like "ATM machine",
	or illogical syntax, such as the countable use of "DLC".
	Note also that I am not prescribing any linguistic change,
	but merely pointing out some counterintuitive word formations,
	along with providing hypothetical "logical" alternatives.
	<ol>
		<li><b>antisemitism</b> - is generally only applied to jews, not to any other semitic group.
		Should therefore be "antijudaism".</li>
		<li><b>caucasian</b> - generally applied to people and cultures with no ties to the Caucasus.
		Ironically, many Caucasians would not be considered caucasian by American standards.
		The common synonym "white" is (slightly) more logical,
		although ideally one would avoid this outdated and arbitrary racial classification system entirely.</li>
		<li>(math) <b>closed & open</b> - unlike in literally any other context, in math, these are not mutually exclusive.
		Unfortunately, there are no obvious replacements - perhaps "limit-containing" and "limit-bounded", respectively?</li>
		<li><b>copyright</b> - on its surface, appears to indicate one's right to copy.
		In actuality, it is the opposite.
		"Intellectual property rights" or the less obvious but shorter "uncopiability" may be suitable alternatives.</li>
		<li>(American politics) <b>democrat & republican</b> - if you know nothing of American politics, you would assume
		democrats are anti-republic and pro-democracy, and republicans are ant-democracy and pro-republic.
		Snide comments aside, both largely support the continuance of the current system of power investiture (ie., a democratic republic).
		Many other countries use the more logical naming of "liberal" and "conservative", respectively, for similar parties,
		although "liberal" has its own problems.
		If it were up to me, though, I would either choose the existing "left-right" terminology,
		or invent a new meaning for "evolutionary" or "mutational" to contrast with "conservative".
		Don't even get me started on the backwards colors...</li>
		<li><b>preferred pronoun</b> - an unfortunate continuance of the same trivializing anti-queer attitudes that spawned terms like "sexual preference".
		Thankfully, the simple "pronoun" alone is already gaining ground without any prescriptivist intervention.
		If further specificity is somehow required, perhaps "identifying pronoun" would be a good fit.</li>
		<li><b>quiet quitting</b> - not even remotely quitting. It is quiet, though. A better term might be "jaded compliance".</li>
		<li><b>social distancing</b> - on the surface, appears to contrast with physical distancing - yet the two are one and the same.
		Perhaps a better alternative would be something like "hygienic distancing".</li>
	</ol>
	I don't see these talked about often. I guess most folks just take these terms for granted.

	So, the game I've been working on.

	I think before I release a public alpha, I need to add more events,
	missions, and more locations outside the city.
	Ideally, I would also like to create an interface for modders to create their own events and missions.
	The game already has support for modding in new NPCs, locations, and items,
	and I think event and mission mods would REALLY increase the replayability potential.

	I've tried to make it so anything the player can do, NPCs can do, and vice versa.

	Alright, now a little snapshot of the present news to reflect on in the future.
	DeSantis's polling has been falling, and Kennedy's polling has been rising.
	At this point, Biden vs. Kennedy polls and Trump vs. DeSantis polls look like mirrors of each other -
	they both seem to be hovering around 55% vs. 15%.
	Sadly, Williamson is hovering around 6% and doesn't currently seem to have much of a chance.
	I tried to think if there are any republicans I would even consider voting for.
	But no, after researching every minor candidate, <i>literally every last one</i> is anti-LGBT.
	So, I think the flowchart for how I'll end up voting in 2024 will look like this:
	<br><br>
	<b>*</b> &rarr; Who is the Democratic nominee?
	<ul>
		<li><b>Williamson</b> &rarr; vote Dem.</li>
		<li><b>Biden</b> &rarr; Is my state projected to be a close vote? (Likely)
			<ul>
				<li><b>Yes</b> &rarr; vote Dem.</li>
				<li><b>No</b> &rarr; vote Green.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Kennedy</b> &rarr; vote Green.</li>
	</ul>
	Alternatively, if a left-wing (or at this point, even a centrist) third-party candidate seems to be gaining traction,
	I might take the risk and vote for them.

	@title The Death of Escapism
	@date 1695667681570
	@tags namei site dev meta transition
	Almost six weeks ago, my life underwent a massive shift.
	Colossal. Indescribably large.
	@p
	No longer do I have any urge to add to Namei,
	aside from minor additions stemming from fixing problems with preexisting content.
	@p
	(In terms of practical changes for this site:
	I will still update it, but very, very irregularly...)
	@p
	Moreover, my seemingly incessant desire to code something... <em>anything</em>...
	that has persisted for over a decade has also come to a halt.
	@p
	I didn't even notice until someone pointed it out to me.
	Strangely though, losing what have been core parts of my identity half my life hasn't bothered me at all.
	I was, however, baffled as to the cause.
	I mean, <em>other than the E</em>, of course :^).
	But after a month of thinking, it came to me.
	@p
	Escapism.
	I desperately wanted to leave my reality.
	No, <em>needed</em>.
	I created fantasy worlds so I wouldn't have to think of my own.
	Alternate history? Another Earth? Futurism?
	Didn't matter. Anything <em>but</em> here.
	@p
	I entered barely-conscious trances where my only reality was <em>code</em>.
	Where I would wake up, code for 16, 18, 20 hours, until I was so hungry I couldn't code anymore,
	so thirsty I couldn't code anymore, or so drowsy I couldn't code anymore.
	Then I would reluctantly take care of my body's bothersome <em>nagging</em>, but only <em>just enough</em> to keep me working.
	It didn't matter what I was making. It didn't matter if I would ever use it.
	It just had to give me enough of its own problems to distract me from my own.
	@p
	That sounds like self-torture, now that I write that down, but it didn't feel like it.
	<em>Reality</em> was self-torture.
	Now that I see clearly, <em>it was there</em>.
	Half my life, <em>it was there</em>.
	My need for escapism kept growing, and growing, and growing.
	@p
	Well, not anymore.
	I can't roll back the clock and relive my life how I always wanted,
	but I <em>can</em> forge a new path ahead.
	A good path. <em>My</em> good path.

	@title Snapshot of the Present
	@date 1699979477371
	@tags news 2024_election
	Since it's been three and a half months since my previous snapshot, time to give an update for posterity.
	Since last time:
	<ul>
		<li>DeSantis's polling has continued to fall, but he is still #2 at ~14%</li>
		<li>Nikki Haley has surged somewhat in the polls, but is still at ~9%</li>
		<li>Ramaswamy has fallen to ~5%. Aside from Trump, no other candidate is polling above 5%.
			Additionally, Tim Scott dropped out two days ago.</li>
		<li>Kennedy is now running as in independent, and is polling slightly better in general election polls.</li>
		<li>Four-way general election polling: Trump 39%, Biden 37%, RFK Jr. 15%, Cornel West 4%.</li>
	</ul>
	@p
	The sheer number of people voting for third-party candidates this election year hasn't happened since Perot.
	In fact, in three-way polls, Kennedy polls significantly higher than Perot did in 1992 (I have seen values as high as 28%).
	A third-party candidate has never received such a large fraction of the vote since the 1912 election.
	@p
	Polling seems to suggest Kennedy's presence hurts Trump more than Biden, but only slightly. Normalized to 100%:
	<ul>
		<li>2-way: Trump: 50.61%; Biden: 49.39%</li>
		<li>3-way (w/ Kennedy): Trump: 41.54%; Biden: 42.83%; Kennedy 15.63%</li>
		<li>3-way (w/ West): Trump: 47.74%; Biden: 46.05%; West 6.21%</li>
		<li>4-way: Trump: 41.35%; Biden: 38.50%; Kennedy: 16.14%; West 4.01%</li>
	</ul>
	These ratios suggest Kennedy's support comes 58% from otherwise-Trump supporters and 42% from otherwise-Biden supporters.
	Similarly, West seems to be pulling 54% from Biden and 46% from Trump.
	@p
	General election polling for my state seems to lean fairly strongly in favor of Trump (avg +5),
	so I might end up voting for West as a protest candidate.

	@date 1705932486942

	I uploaded a Youtube video in the first time in over 1&frac12; years, although it is only 5 seconds long.
	I do plan on making longer education/rant style videos later this year, but we'll have to see.
	@p
	@tags site js dev
	I created several calendrical tools for the Eremoran, Gregrorian, and "Mocha Lunisolar" calendars.
	They're useful enough for me to reference them myself in day-to-day activities.

	@tags news 2024_election
	Since it's been two months since my previous snapshot, time to give an update for posterity.
	Since last time:
	<ul>
		<li>DeSantis, Ramaswamy, and every other relevant republican challenger to Trump has dropped out. Except...</li>
		<li>...Nikki Haley, polling nationally at 12%, and in New Hampshire at a significant 36%.</li>
	</ul>
	It is quite possible by the time I can vote in this primary, there will be no choices left to vote for.
	<br><br>
	An update on 3/4-way race figures:
	<ul>
		<li>2-way: Trump: 51.10%; Biden: 48.90%</li>
		<li>3-way (w/ Kennedy): Trump: 41.39%; Biden: 37.31%; Kennedy 21.30%</li>
	</ul>
	I can't seem to find figures with just West anymore, but he has been polling around 2%.
	@p
	@tags weather
	I found this morning the recent January frost clawing at my cheeks.
	The sun once again rises on my morning commute, rather than after.
	@p
	I once more took up journalling after a nearly 4-year hiatus.

	@title What's in a Name?
	@date 1706533200000
	@tags transition
	I am changing my name. I am certain of my first name (Luna).
	Although I don't care for middle names, for logistical/bureaucratic reasons it is evident I will need one.
	Some options I have thought of:
	<ul>
	<li>Luna <b>Celestia</b> - Luna's complement in FiM</li>
		<li>Luna <b>Cynthia Selene</b> - two Greek names for the moon</li>
		<li>Luna <b>Lilith</b> - although this goes against my personal ban on abrahamic names, <em>Lilith</em> is just so badass.</li>
		<li>Luna <b>Molly</b> - after probably my favorite book protagonist growing up, Molly Moon.
			That universe was one of the early targets of my "dysphoria-escapist" desires.
			Bonus: her last name is <em>literally</em> Moon.</li>
		<li>Luna <b>Sapphira</b> - one of my original top first name choices -
			named after an old friend. Alternates: Alyssa, Emily, Emma, Mallory, Xanthe.</li>
		<li>Luna <b>Sappho</b> - the OG lesbian</li>
		<li>Luna <b>Victoria</b> - I mean, I do like playing Vicky...</li>
		<li>Luna <b>[Another Latin name]</b><ul>
			<li>Luna <b>Nox</b> - night</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li>Luna <b>[Eremoran name]</b> - this would certainly be reflective of myself.
			Unfortunately, Eremoran names aren't really phonoaesthetic in English,
			eg. <em>Siardor</em> or <em>Erekaflar</em>.
			Humorously, <em>Tranzfemar</em> would be a valid dithetmatic name - it means <em>hidden rose</em>.</li>
		<li>Luna <b>[Galilean Moon]</b> - unfortunately,<ul>
			<li>Luna <b>Io</b> - to modern English phonoaesthetics, -o names are masculine.</li>
			<li>Luna <b>Europa</b> - not gonna share names with a continent, sorry.</li>
			<li>Luna <b>Ganymede</b> - male name.</li>
			<li>Luna <b>Callisto</b> - ditto Io.</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li>Luna <b>[Tolkien Elvish name]</b> - although I don't associate much with LotR, elvish names are aesthetic, and would add a worldbuilding component to my name's meaning personally relevant to me:<ul>
			<li>Luna <b>Galadriel</b> - badass elf bitch</li>
			</ul></li>
	</ul>
	Clearly, I have a lot to decide.

	@title Voice
	@date 1708979425604
	@tags transition
	I think I've officially given up on voice training guides.
	I tried for a year, made no progress, understood nothing, gave up,
	and tried a strategy of "throw shit at a wall and see what sticks"
	for six months, and...
	well, that strategy <i>actually sorta worked a bit</i>.
	I mean, my voice is still on the masc end of androgynous,
	but at least it's not <i>totally</i> masc!
	@p
	So I thought to myself, okay, maybe now that I've made progress,
	I'll understand all the jargon being thrown around.
	Nope.
	I guess like my brain is just wired wrong (aside from the obvious...).
	Sample clips of vocal dimensions ("weight", "resonance", "brightness", "radioactivity", ...)
	<b>all</b> straight-up sound like either just a difference in pitch,
	or absolutely no audible difference whatsoever.
	So it is no wonder guides never made sense to me.
	@p
	And then, of course, it doesn't help that it seems like different people use the same terms differently
	(or maybe this is my 'weight/resonance/etc-blindness'... who knows)
	@p
	I feel like I'm being gaslit that there is more to voice than pitch.
	I mean, I can tell male voices from female voices.
	I can tell there's <i>more</i> than just pitch to it.
	But I can't "hear" these other dimensions, no matter how hard I try.
	Pardon to bring mathematics into this, <i>but</i>...
	@p
	@tags math
	To my ears, it sounds like voice has a basis of two vectors:
	pitch, and this other indescribable quality.
	But (assuming I'm not just being gaslit by everyone else in the world, which is an assumption I'm gradually doubting more and more),
	this quality is <i>absolutely not</i> anything I've heard from guides.
	So the only reasonable explanation I can come up with is that I am just defective, broken,
	and my mind collapses dimensions others hear distinctly into a single other dimension.
	@p
	Anyways, I think I may permanently be stuck in a "masc androgynous" zone,
	which is pretty depressing.

	@title Vote
	@date 1729369222230
	@tags 2024_election
	To give an election update, since I haven't in a while: I voted yesterday.
	The line at the polling place was the longest I've seen since 2016.
	Although I have hope Harris will win NC, I suspect Trump will still win the election as a whole.
	Before early voting results were available, I did some quick napkin math and found these approximate odds:
	<ul>
		<li>55.5% Harris</li>
		<li>42.2% Trump</li>
		<li>2.3% EV Tie</li>
	</ul>
	Based on current early voting data though, I actually think Trump's odds are much higher,
	much higher than even on the betting odds website - something like 70%, again, based on napkin math - and a near-zero chance of a tie.
	That said, because I love chaos, I'm hoping for this map:
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/l088nsQ.png"/>
	Which 538 currently suggests has about a (0.52)(0.37)(0.51)(0.47)(0.5)(0.42)(0.63) ~ <strong>0.61% (1 in 164)</strong> chance of happening.
	This actually agrees with 538's modal outcome except in AZ, MI, and NC.
	538's modal outcome is 281-257 in favor of Trump with odds of (0.52)(0.63)(0.51)(0.53)(0.58)(0.63)(0.5) ~ <strong>1.62% (1 in 62)</strong>.

	@p
	There are two other probable tie outcomes:
	<ul>
		<li>The same, but with NC and GA swapped: (0.52)(0.37)(0.51)(0.47)(0.5)(0.58)(0.37) ~ <strong>0.49% (1 in 202)</strong></li>
		<li>The same, but with GA, WI, and NV swapped: (0.52)(0.37)(0.51)(0.47)(0.5)(0.58)(0.37) ~ <strong>0.32% (1 in 315)</strong></li>
	</ul>
	The total chance of a tie is not much more than the sum of these three odds: <strong>1.42% (1 in 70)</strong>.

	Some worldgen observations:
	<ul class="list2">
		<li>Apparently "cave generation" is just randomly erasing 1/3 of tiles after generation. It sure seems like a lot less, but after some in-game verification it indeed appears about 1/3 of tiles are empty, and the distribution is random.</li>
		<li>Interestingly, even though Ironium is always rarer than Bronzium, Bronzium is worth twice as much. This apparent bug is due to ore generation being split into tiers - Bronzium cannot appear in the third ore generation tier, and Ironium cannot appear in the first or second ore generation tiers, because the tier bonus is added AFTER generating the random integer in the range, rather than being added to the range.</li>
		<li>Generation of "treasures" is uniform throughout the applicable range (below 1,000 ft.), and the four treasure types are equally distributed.</li>
		<li>The world is evenly divided into ranges, where in a particular range, ore tiers 0..n generate equally often, the n+1-th tier is 5 times rarer, and the n+2-th tier is 25 times rarer.</li>
	</ul>

	@p
	Some code observations:
	<ul class="list2">
		<li>Internally, gas traps are called "l".</li>
		<li>Internally, the rewards you get at the end of the game use the same structure as ores.</li>

	Did you know higher-tier ores are also heavier, taking more cargo space?
	Every ore above Silverium is denser than the last.
	As for value density, more valuable ores are always more value-dense as well (which isn't terribly surprising, but I figure it'd be worth a check).

	@title Generating Colorblind-friendly Color Palettes
	@date 1741082724928
	@tags dev js math
	I needed to create a color map to visualize the values in <a href="../tools/goods.html">goods.js</a>.
	My first attempt made it difficult even for me (someone who's very much not colorblind) to tell points off,
	which means it would probably be <em>doubly</em> difficult for someone who <em>is</em> colorblind.
	So after some searching I found a simple color mapping, sampled some points on it and fit it to a cubic and then called it a day.
	But then I wondered if I could create my <em>own</em> colorblind-friendly color palette.
	Or, better yet, have a program randomly generate them for me.
	I went through a lot of failed ideas but eventually I came up with this:
	@p
	We need a color scale with monotonically increasing perceptual brightness.
	Ideally, the brightness increases will be equally spaced along the scale.
	Human eyes are most sensitive to green light, followed by red light, and then blue light.
	<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/596243">Stack Overflow</a> gives the following formula to calculate this:
	<code>0.2126*R + 0.7152*G + 0.0722*B</code>
	We are representing each color channel as a cubic polynomial f(x), with x in [0, 1] and f(x) in [0, 255] (you will see later why we're using cubics).
	<code>f(x) = a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d</code>
	Due to our brightness constraint, f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 255 for all channels.
	This requires that d = 0 and a + b + c + d = 255
	So we can therefore simplify our cubics to this:
	<code>f(x) = a x^3 + b x^2 + (255 - a - b) x</code>
	It may seem like we can now just plug in whatever values for a and b we want, but there's a catch:
	not all combinations of a and b will result in a function that outputs numbers strictly in [0, 255].
	As an example:
	<code>f(x) = -128 x^3 + 383 x</code>
	This has a maximum at:
	<code>(sqrt(2298)/48, 383sqrt(2298)/72) ~ (0.999, 255.007)</code>
	But how can we prevent generating cubics that produce values outside our range?
	Well, the simplest way would be to ensure they are monotonically increasing, which ensures our local extrema must be at the bounds of our range -
	which we have defined to be 0 and 1 anyways.
	If a cubic is monotonically increasing, its derivative must not have any roots:
	<code>f'(x) = 3a x^2 + 2b x + (255 - a - b) â‰  0 </code>
	Since its derivative is a quadratic, that means the determinant of the derivative must be negative:
	<code>(2b)^2 - 4*(3a)*(255 - a - b) < 0</code>
	<code>b^2 - 765a + 3a^2 + 3ab < 0</code>
	This is a quadratic in b. Since the quadratic coefficient is positive (1), for this inequality to be true, b must lie between the two roots of this polynomial.
	<code>b^2 + 3ab + (3a^2 - 765a) < 0</code>
	<code>roots = (-3a Â± sqrt((3a)^2 - 4*1*(3a^2 - 765a)))/(2*1)</code>
	<code>roots = (-3a Â± sqrt(-3a^2 + 3060a))/2</code>
	<code>(-3a - sqrt(-3a^2 + 3060a))/2 â‰¤ b â‰¤ (-3a + sqrt(-3a^2 + 3060a))/2</code>
	Since we need to actually have roots, this imposes a new constraint on a:
	<code>0 â‰¤ -3a^2 + 3060a</code>
	<code>0 â‰¤ a â‰¤ 1020</code>
	We simply generate random a, b for the red and blue channels, and derive the green channel from these.
	(Since the perceptual brightness function weights green so heavily, we need to derive green from red and blue to ensure the green cubic can satisfy these constraints).
	@p
	I have implemented this in <a href="https://github.com/Mocha2007/mocha2007.github.io/blob/master/tools/gradienttest.js#L170">gradienttest.js</a>,
	And you can fiddle around with it on <a href="../tools/gradient_test.html">gradient_test.html</a> in the console using
	<code>GRADIENT.random();</code>
	@p
	Some notes:
	<ul class="list2">
		<li>It would be much more difficult to compute these constraints with higher-degree polynomials, which is why we're sticking to cubics. They provide enough flexibility anyways.</li>
		<li>The exact color channel weights for the perceptual brightness formula don't necessarily matter for this algorithm, and you can swap them for other values if you want.</li>
		<li>In case you need to know the implied bounds on b and c: 0 â‰¤ c â‰¤ 1020, and -510 sqrt(3) - 765 â‰¤ b â‰¤ 510 sqrt(3) - 765 (appx. -1648 â‰¤ b â‰¤ 68)</li>

	@title Polynomial Root Probabilities
	@date 1741116360799
	@tags math
	I computed the approximate probability of a polynomial of a given degree having a certain number of real roots (computationally),
	given that the coefficients are uniformly randomly chosen from [-1, 1]:
	<ol>
		<li>1: 100%</li>
		<li>0: 37.1863%, 2: 62.8137%</li>
		<li>1: 78.2289%, 3: 21.7711%</li>
		<li>0: 23.5942%, 2: 69.7628%, 4: 6.6430%</li>
	</ol>
	Since all polynomials in R can be expressed as a scaled version of these,
	this also applies to all polynomials in R.
	@p
	Now the question is... why these numbers specifically???
