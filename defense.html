<title>If we were to spend Defense on...</title>
<div id="nav"></div>
<div id="top"><h1 id="If_we_were_to_spend_Defense_on...">If we were to spend Defense on...</h1></div>
The United States spends $584 Billion on defense annually.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> That's enough to...

<h2 id="Establish_14_Lunar_Colonies">Establish 14 Lunar Colonies... every year.</h2>
<p>Yes. Not 14 <i>total</i>. 14 <i>per year</i>. The cost of such a lunar colony is estimated at $40B, as of 2015.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Assuming a 20-man crew each, we could have twenty-three thousand Americans on the moon by the end of the century. At that population, about 700 moon babies would be born annually.</p>

<h2 id="Send_one_million_people_to_Mars">Send one million people to Mars... every year.</h2>
<p>SpaceX is considering a project to send people to Mars. At least, they were in 2012. They estimated the cost to send colonists to Mars, per person, is $500K.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="Build_an_Imperial_Star_Destroyer">Build an Imperial Star Destroyer... (almost) every year.</h2>
<p>Now, obviously we don't have space lasers <i>that</i> powerful (oh wait, we do<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>), or even ion engines (oh wait, we do<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>), but we sure as hell can make a 1:1 scale replica model of the Imperial Star Destroyer, for just $636B.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="Build_94_Space_Elevators">Build 94 Space Elevators... every year.</h2>
<p>The cost of constructing a single space elevator was estimated to be $6.2B in 2004.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> This equates to being able to construct 94 space elevators, every year.</p>

<h2 id="Build_more_than_250,000_Miles_of_Roads">Build more than 250,000 Miles of Roads... every year.</h2>
<p>The cost of building a road is quite variable, apparently, but in ideal places it can be as low as $2M per mile.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> This equates to being able to construct over 250,000 miles of road, every year. That's more than the distance between the Earth and the moon!</p>

<h2 id="Deport_every_American">Deport every American in only 6 Years.</h2>
<p>ICE apparently spends an average of $10,854 per deportee.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> This equates to being able to deport every single American in a little over 6 years.

<h2 id="Fund_Everything">Fund Universal Healthcare. And Free College Education. And Solve World Hunger. And Quadruple NASA's budget. With Hundreds of Billions annually to Spare.</h2>
<p>Even using the high-end estimates for universal healthcare and free college education here<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> and here<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>, we would still have over $400B annually to spare.</p>

<p>Maybe we could pave some roads, too? I mean, downsizing the military by even 20% gives us so much money I literally can't find anything else to do with it. Solving world hunger would cost a measly $30B<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>, but that <i>still</i> leaves a ton of income to spare.</p>

<p>Quadrupling NASA's budget would cost less than $60B per year<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>, so even with that there's still over $300 Billion to spare. Screw it, I'm out of ideas.</p>


<h2 id="Conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>
<p><i>What the hell</i> are we spending $584 Billion on, exactly?</p>
