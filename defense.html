<div id="top"><h1>If we were to spend Defense on...</h1></div>
The United States spends $584 Billion on defense annually.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> That's enough to...

<h2>Establish 14 Lunar Colonies... every year.</h2>
Yes. Not 14 <i>total</i>. 14 <i>per year</i>. The cost of such a lunar colony is estimated at $40B, as of 2015.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Assuming a 20-man crew each, we could have twenty-three thousand Americans on the moon by the end of the century. At that population, about 700 moon babies would be born annually.

<h2>Send one million people to Mars... every year.</h2>
SpaceX is considering a project to send people to Mars. At least, they were in 2012. They estimated the cost to send colonists to Mars, per person, is $500K.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>

<h2>Build an Imperial Star Destroyer... (almost) every year.</h2>
Now, obviously we don't have space lasers <i>that</i> powerful (oh wait, we do<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>), or even ion engines (oh wait, we do<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>), but we sure as hell can make a 1:1 scale replica model of the Imperial Star Destroyer, for just $636B.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>

<h2>Build 94 Space Elevators... every year.</h2>
The cost of costructing a single space elevator was estimated to be $6.2B in 2004.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> This equates to being able to construct 94 space elevators, every year.

<h2>Build more than 250,000 Miles of Roads... every year.</h2>
The cost of building a road is quite variable, apparently, but in ideal places it can be as low as $2M per mile.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> This equates to being able to construct over 250,000 miles of road, every year. That's more than the distance between the Earth and the moon!

<h2>Deport every American in only 6 Years.</h2>
ICE apparently spends an average of $10,854 per deportee.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> This equates to being able to deport every single American in a little over 6 years.

<h2>Fund Universal Healthcare. And Free College Education. And Solve World Hunger. And Quadruple NASA's budget. With Hundreds of Billions annually to Spare.</h2>
Even using the high-end estimates for universal healthcare and free college education here<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> and here<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>, we would still have over $400B annually to spare.
<br/><br/>
Maybe we could pave some roads, too? I mean, downsizing the military by even 20% gives us so much money I literally can't find anything else to do with it. Solving world hunger would cost a measly $30B<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>, but that <i>still</i> leaves a ton of income to spare.
<br/><br/>
Quadrupling NASA's budget would cost less than $60B per year<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>, so even with that there's still over $300 Billion to spare. Screw it, I'm out of ideas.


<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<i>What the hell</i> are we spending $584 Billion on, exactly? Certainly not on our veterans, that's for sure!
