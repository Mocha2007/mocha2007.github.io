<!--
	My ultimate goal is to use the Maian part of the Namei converse
	to create Victoria 3 and HOI4 mods.
	<< Foundations dug 14 Jul 2021 >>

	For Imperator, Pankair on Oneia seems to be the obvious choice.

	As for EU4 and CK3, I am not sure which world would be the most fitting.

	For Stellaris I could perhaps add a Pitang-Ra mod.
-->
<!--
	Resource notes for HOI4:
	most resources stay the same
	Steel -> Iron (Iron is abundant in pure form and won't oxidize. Also, no bessemer process.)
	Oil -> Ice (LOX is used as a fuel source and is extracted from ice via electrolysis)
	+ Wood (Well, this world's standard of "wood")
	+ Quol (Coal-like seams formed of silicates from dead "plant" matter)
-->

<h2>General Warfare Technology Notes</h2>
<p>
	Due to the slightly lower surface gravity and substantially higher surface pressure,
	flight will be much easier to attain.
	Conversely, due to the halved density of liquid methane,
	naval action may be much more challenging.
	Thus there will be have an increased focus on air combat,
	and a decreased focus on naval combat, relative to Earth.
	I currently have Maian "technoloy time" pegged at 1850's earth,
	give or take a couple decades for slight differences in development.
	I plan to start about 25 years (~5 Maian years) before "present" (~960 AT on Oneia).
</p>
<h2>Weather and Climate Notes</h2>
<p>
	I suspect methane can achieve the same "humidity" effect as water,
	so in that respect I feel rainfall rules will be similar,
	just temperature-scaled.
	Methane "snow" and related precipitation will definitely be possible.
</p>
<h2>Calendar</h2>
<p>
	The timekeeping epoch commonly used on Maia has an epoch about 1225 terran years ago.
	This corresponds to ~7th century CE technology,
	and means it is currently about 245 Maian years since the epoch.
</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<h3>Terrain</h3>
<p>
	The surface is approximately 60% methane sea, 40% land.
	The water cycle works much the same on Maia as Earth,
	but with methane instead of water.
	This means methane clouds, rivers, and seas.
</p>
<h3>Political Geography</h3>
<p>
	There are about a dozen great powers of varying strength.
	Most are on their rise but a couple are in the midst of collapse.
	Most GPs are on the same continent, two are immediately adjacent,
	and two are on the "colonial" continents.
</p>
<p>
	Colonialism was much less influential on Maia.
	It took nearly an entire Maian century before GPs took substantial interest
	in the other half of the world.
	This allowed the stone- and bronze-age societieis of those continents
	to slowly and carefully acclimate to the technology of the old world,
	now being only one or two earth-centuries behind.
</p>
<p>
	The heartland of GPs is centered on the western side of a continent.
	The climate of the region ranges from mediterranean to semiarid
	to full-on hot (Well, by Maian standards) desert.
