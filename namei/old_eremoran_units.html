<p>
	The basic Eremoran units of measurement are based on the size of their bricks (<span class="eremoran">labnim</span> <em>labnim</em>). 
	The standard unit of mass (<em>labnim</em>) is approximately <span class="autoconvert-u">1.188 kg</span>. 
	This word is also used for the basic unit of length, approximately <span class="autoconvert-u">170.4 mm</span>,
	and volume, approximately <span class="autoconvert-u">618.5 mL</span>. 
	One Eremoran brick weighs 1 <em>labnim</em>, has dimensions 1 by 1/2 by 1/4 <em>labnim</em>, and has a volume of 1 <em>labnim</em>.
	<!--Eremoran bricks are 1:2:4, Muran bricks are 2:3:6. Specialized/Regional ratios include 3:5:15 (dz^engar brick), -->
</p>
<p>
	Other units include the 'great journey' (<span class="eremoran">ahkaudom</span> <em>afkakum</em>),
	which was roughly how far a message could be run by messengers in one day,
	or, alternatively, half the distance it can be sent by horse in a day,
	or 128 <em>abakêum sesusesum</em>, equivalent to about <span class="autoconvert-u">562 km</span>, 
	the 'hundred hundreds' (<span class="eremoran">sesusesum</span> <em>sesusesum</em>),
	equivalent to <span class="autoconvert-u">2.904 a</span>, 
	and the 'cartographer's ten-thousand' (<span class="eremoran">abakêum sesusesum</span> <em>abakêum sesusesum</em>),
	or <em>abakêum</em> for short,
	equivalent to <span class="autoconvert-u">4.390 km</span> (One-ten-thousandth the circumference of Oneia).

	The <em>afkakum</em> is used by the military to describe any significant distance, and by the general public to describe far distances. 
	The <em>abakêum</em> is used for milemarkers, but it is also used by cartographers and sailors for long distances due to its easy computation from the circumference of Oneia. 
	For example, the distance between Eremor and Deftei as written on a milemarker would be 51 <abbr title="abakêum sesusesum">ass</abbr> 100 <abbr title="abakêum labnium sesum">ls</abbr> 
	(<span class="autoconvert-u">206.1 km</span> - distances are marked every 50 <em>abakêum labnium sesum</em>.). 
	And the distance between Deftei and Inora as written on a milemarker would be
	14 <abbr title="abakêum sesusesum">ass</abbr> 50 <abbr title="abakêum labnium sesum">ls</abbr> (<span class="autoconvert-u">62.7 km</span>). 
	in this respect, the <em>abakêum sesusesum</em> and <em>abakêum labnium sesum</em> are used much like <em>miles</em> and <em>chains</em>. 
	Both the <em>labnium sesum</em> and <em>labnium sesusesum</em>, are used to describe distances within the same city or locale. 
	For example, the distance between two neighborhoods could be described as two <em>labnium sesusesum</em>, and a city block could be described as being ten <em>labnium sesum</em> long. 
	The <em>labnim</em> is used for the shortest measurements, such as the height of a person,
	which averages <abbr title="1.7 m or 5 ft 7 in">10 l</abbr>, or lane width, <abbr title="3.4 m or 11 ft">20 l</abbr>. 
	The <em>labnim</em> is divided into four parts, <em>labnium edzam</em>, or <em>edzam</em> for short, used in more precise measurements. 
	The <em>edzam</em>, the second-shortest named measurement, is thus <span class="autoconvert-u">42.6 mm</span>. 
	The <em>se</em>, the shortest named measurement, is one-fifteenth of one <em>edzam</em>,
	and thus <span class="autoconvert-u">2.84 mm</span>.

<p>
	In practice, only the se, edzam, and labnim are used for mass,
	but the theoretical values of the other units are displayed here for comparison.
	Larger lengths could be constructed using <em>afkaudoisum</em> with as many <em>sesu</em> as required.
	For example, the distance between Oneia and Namei could be expressed as about 8.5 <em>afkaudoisum sesusesum</em>.
	For comparison, the distance to Nikki is merely about 64 <em>afkakum</em>.
</p>
<p>
	Although speed is not a particularly important measurement in the era of Eremor,
	distance per time is usually given as <em>abakêum</em> per first division, 
	and 1 <abbr title="abakêum sesusesum per first division">ab/d<sub>1</sub></abbr> is about
	<span class="autoconvert-u">1.517 km/h</span>. 
	Angles are given as times; 360&deg; is equal to 10 <abbr title="first division">d<sub>1</sub></abbr>, or one day.
