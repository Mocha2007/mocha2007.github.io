<p>
	I do image edits for fun, so they are free. 
	Currently the only form of donations I can take rn are commissions, so don't worry about payment XD.
	Just message me on newgrounds or twitter or something. 
	I'd prefer you to cite me as the artist if you plan on using this somewhere. 
	I do rapid, low-to-medium quality image editing requests. 
	This includes everything from minor antique photo restoration to editing the Queen bulldozing Obama. 
	I'm not good at drawing but I try to satisfy those requests too. 
	Sample of my work:
