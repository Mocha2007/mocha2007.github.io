<title>Things to Consider when trying to Convert Atheists</title>
<div id="nav"></div>
<div id="top"><h1 id="Converting_Atheists">Things to Consider when trying to Convert Atheists</h1></div>
<p>
	Here are some things to consider when trying to convert atheists - this page is directed towards christians who want to convert an atheist. 
</p>

<h2 id="Atheists_are_a_Minority">Atheists are a Minority</h2>
<p>
	Atheists are a minority. 
	Unlike you, our religious beliefs are questioned often, and are held to far more scrutiny. 
	Imagine if people would come up to you and ask you the exact same questions over and over, questions like, 
	"How can you be sure there is a god?", "What if you don't like atheism because you haven't tried it yet?", or, "Have you read <i>The God Delusion</i>?". 
	As you can imagine, being asked these same questions repeatedly can become quite annoying, and it is most conducive to a discussion about religion to annoy as little as possible. 
</p>

<h2 id="Atheists_are_not_Anti-Theists">Atheists are not Anti-Theists</h2>
<p>
	Atheists, or, at least, <i>most</i> atheists, are <i>not</i> anti-theists. 
	We do not believe <i>no</i> god exists, we simply don't believe <i>any</i> god exists. 
	This can be confusing to some, so I offer two tables: 
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th rowspan=2>/</th>
		<th colspan=3>I believe the accused...</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>is innocent.</td>
		<td>may or may not be guilty.</td>
		<td>is guilty.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Vote</th>
		<td colspan=2>NOT GUILTY</td>
		<td>GUILTY</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br/>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th rowspan=2>/</th>
		<th colspan=3>I believe god(s)...</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>don't exist.</td>
		<td>may or may not exist.</td>
		<td>exist.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Position</th>
		<td colspan=2>Atheist</td>
		<td>Theist</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan=4><i>Or, more specifically:</i></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>"</th>
		<td><i>Anti-Theist</i><br/>or<br/><i>Hard Atheist</i><br/>or<br/><i>Positive Atheist</i></td>
		<td><i>Agnostic</i><br/>or<br/><i>Soft Atheist</i><br/>or<br/><i>Negative Atheist</i></td>
		<td><i>Theist</i></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="Atheists_are_not_Christians">Atheists are not Christians</h2>
<p>
	Atheists are not christians. 
	Asking us if we've read the bible is unlikely to help, especially since many atheists are ex-christians ourselves. 
	Realize that, regardless,  atheists do not believe much of what the bible says to be true, much like Muslims or Buddhists. 
	Some atheists believe that Jesus existed, but we do not believe he was more than a man. 
	Most atheists do not believe he existed, however, we don't believe he <i>didn't</i> exist, on this we are merely unsure. 
</p>
<p>
	Atheists do not believe in God, and so if you're wondering, <i>"Do atheists just hate God?"</i>, the answer is no, just like we don't hate unicorns, or fairies, or leprechauns. 
	Likewise, atheists don't believe in Satan, so we don't worship him either. 
</p>

<h2 id="Understand_Atheists">Understand Atheists' Positions</h2>
<p>
	You're not going to convert an atheist unless you understand where we come from. 
	Here are the positions of most, but not all, atheists. 
</p>

<h3 id="Christmas">Christmas</h3>
<p>
	Like many, most atheists celebrate christmas as well, but devoid of religion. 
	We participate in the exchange of gifts and many of the other traditions associated with christmas. 
	We do not view christmas as a religious holiday. 
</p>
<p>
	Now, and I may be the only atheist to do this, I still set up a small nativity scene during the holidays too. 
	For me though, it's like one of those office zen gardens; I set it up differently every year, and it's more of a relaxing thing than a spiritual one. 
</p>
<p>
	Just because atheists celebrate this does not make us believers. 
</p>

<h3 id="Death">Death</h3>
<p>
	There are two common questions about death atheists are asked all the time: <i>"Aren't you worried you're going to go to hell?"</i>, and the common follow-up <i>"But what do you think happens when we die?"</i>. 
</p>
<p>
	Again, atheists are not christians. 
	Atheists neither believe in heaven nor hell. 
	You may then ask, "Well, where do you think you go when you die?". 
	Atheist believe that, usually, when we die, we go to a cemetery. 
	And yes, I know how silly that sounds, but we really believe that. 
</p>

<h3 id="Meaning_and_Morals">Meaning of Life and Morality</h3>
<p>
	Other questions atheists are often asked are, <i>"How can life have any meaning without God?"</i>, and, <i>"How do you get your morals without God?"</i>. 
	The answer to these questions varies wildly between atheists. 
	There is no answer even remotely universal among atheists, but in <a href="mochism.html#Meaning_of_Life">the <i>Meaning of Life</i> section on my philosophy page</a>, I explain my personal views. 
	I hope this provides a helpful starting point for you. 
</p>

<h3 id="Origins">Origins of Life and the Universe</h3>
<p>
	Other questions atheists are often asked are, <i>"Then where did everything come from without God?"</i>, and, <i>"Then where did people come from without God?"</i>. 
	Most atheists, although not all, believe the <i>Big Bang</i> and <i>Evolution</i> are the current best answers to these questions. 
	Although you may <i>think</i> you understand these, I'll provide quick summaries so we're all on the same page: 
</p>

<h4 id="Big_Bang">Big Bang</h4>
<p>
	Atheists who believe in the big bang believe it to be the earliest known time, and possibly even the beginning of time itself. 
	The big bang was a singularity that existed billions of years ago and has expanded over time, much like bread does when it is baked or leavened. 
</p>

<h4 id="Evolution">Evolution</h4>
<p>
	Atheists who believe in evolution believe it is a process which causes life to slowly change from one form to another. 
	We believe evolution is a process which not only shaped our ancestors, but still shapes us today. 
	We believe the process which drives evolution is called natural selection. 
	A rather simplistic illustration of this process is the following:

<h2 id="Other_FAQ">Other FAQ</h2>

<h3 id="Angry">Why are Atheists so Angry?</h3>
<p>
	Often times if an atheist is angry about religion, it's because it is encroaching on their personal freedoms. 
	Imagine if you lived in a majority-atheist society which decided to suddenly outlaw churches. 
	Although atheists have no use for churches, I'm sure you would feel as if your faith is being attacked. 
</p>
<p>
	Now, of course, there are quite a few of us which <i>are</i> just angry for no reason... and you should probably just stay far away from them. :P
</p>

<h3 id="What_if_you're_Wrong">But what if you're Wrong?</h3>
<p>
	Depends on who's right. 
	If the Buddhists are right, then we'll be reincarnated, and likely in a better life than before. 
	If the Jews are right, then it won't matter anyways since they don't believe in a hell. 
	But if Chritians or Muslims are right, then I guess we'll be headed to hell! 
	Yes, we have all heard of Pascal's wager. 
	Anyone who has become an atheist has asked themselves this question many, many times. 
	What if <i>you're</i> wrong? 
</p>

<h2 id="Okay,_but_Really">Okay, but Really.</h2>
<p>
	I know I just laid out a bunch of questions atheists get asked all the time, and I know I <i>did</i> say we get annoyed by them, but that doesn't mean we aren't open to questions. 
	The point of this is to make sure you don't sound insulting or ignorant - not to scare you from asking questions.
