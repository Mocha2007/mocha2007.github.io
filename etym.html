Did you know that...
<dl>
	<dt>... <i>bichon</i> <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bichon#Etymology_2">is related to</a> <i>bitch</i>?</dt>
	<dd>I mean, I guess it's not too surprising, but...</dd>
	<dt>... <i>cane</i> <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_derived_from_Sumerian">is one of a handful of English words</a> from Sumerian?</dt>
	<dd>Yup.</dd>
	<dt>... all definitions of <i>check</i> <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/check#Etymology_1">derive from</a> its use in chess?</dt>
	<dd>Yes, all of them.</dd>
	<dt>... <i>crap</i> <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crap#Etymology_1">is related to</a> <i>crop</i>?</dt>
	<dd>The original definition was "grain husk" which devolved into "something of crap quality" and finally into crap, which is pretty crappy.</dd>
	<dt>... <i>faggot</i> <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fascis#Descendants">is related to</a> <i>fascist?</i></dt>
	<dd>Both are descended from Latin <i>fascis</i> 'bundle of sticks', whence also the English loan <i>fasces</i>, the proper term for the bundle.</dd>
	<dt>... the name of # (<i><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hash#Etymology_1">hash</a></i>) is related to <i><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hatchet#Etymology">hatchet</a></i>?</dt>
	<dd>Both come for the Old French for axe.</dd>
	<dt>... <i>rudder</i> is derived from <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/rōþrą">a suffixed form of <i>row</i></a>?</dt>
	<dd>The term used to refer to both oars and rudders, but gradually narrowed to just meaning 'rudder'.</dd>

<h2 id="Germanic_Causative_Umlaut_Pairs">Germanic Causative Umlaut Pairs</h2>
<p>
	Proto-Germanic formed the causative forms of most verbs by simply adding a suffix to the verb.
	This suffix, conveniently, began with an /i/, so it triggered umlaut in North and West Germanic languages.
	In addition, for English specifically, it caused palatalization of velar consonants.
	Here is a list of every pair that exists in English.
	Most of these words are obsolete, however, and many no longer have the same meaning they once had.
