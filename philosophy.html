<h2>Ship of Theseus</h2>
<q>
	The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned from Crete had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, 
	putting in new and stronger timber in their places, in so much that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, 
	and the other contending that it was not the same.
</q>
<p>
	There exist languages where if you told a speaker of this language this 'paradox', they would be completely baffled as to why this is even a paradox in the first place. 
	"Why does it have to be both, or neither?", they say, "Ask any one of my people and they will tell you the same; it is not equal but it acts so.". 
</p>
<p>
	There exist languages that distinguish between an <i>equative</i> copula, that is to say, one that says whether two objects are exactly equal, and a <i>qualitative</i> copula, one that says two objects share common traits, or that one acts as the other, but are not necessarily the same. 
	The Ship of Theseus, in such languages, is not <i>equal</i> to the original, but <i>acts</i> the same. 
	There are languages outside of Europe. 
	I know, shocking.

<h2>If a tree falls in a forest...</h2>
<q>
	If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
</q>
<p>
	If I answer this question on this website, which nobody will ever read, will the question have still been unanswered? 
	No. I answer it here, so whether or not anyone reads this, it will remain answered. 
	Whoever first asked this should probably position themselves under said falling tree.

<h2>If god is good...</h2>
<q>
	If god is good, why is there evil/suffering/Justin Bieber?
</q>
<p>
	You were so close to logically deducing that no benevolent omnipotence could exist. 
	So painfully, painfully close. 
	Here, let me spell it out for you: 
</p>
<p>
	Your god does not exist. 
</p>

<h2>X is an artificial human construct!</h2>
<q>
	X is an artificial human construct, therefore it's stupid.
</q>
<p>
	Literally everything is an artificial human construct. 
	Calling things artificial human constructs is meaningless and a waste. 
</p>
<p>
	Even rocks are artificial human constructs. 
	The rock doesn't actually exist. 
	It's just an impermanent connected collection of molecules which can be cloven or combined at any time. 
	If a rock is the collection of all molecules contained within it, then it is impossible to touch a rock - you can only touch its surface, and mathematically this would be touching <i>nearly none</i> of the rock. 
	But then if you define a rock as the surface of the collection, then you're saying everything inside the rock is not part of the rock. 
	You can continue this line of reasoning and conclude it is impossible to touch any object and that all tangible objects have no volume. 
</p>
<p>
	Where does this get us? Literally nowhere. 
	Still want to play the semantics game?ï»¿
