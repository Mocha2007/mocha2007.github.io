	<dt id="aileronroll">Aileron Roll</dt>
	<dd>
	The <b>aileron roll</b> is an aerobatic maneuver in which an <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> does a full 360Â° revolution about its <a href="#roll">longitudinal</a> axis. 
	When executed properly, there is no appreciable change in altitude and the aircraft exits the maneuver on the same heading as it entered.

	The <b>fuselage</b> is an <a href="#aircraft">aircraft's</a> main body section. 
	It holds crew, passengers, and cargo. 
	In single-engine aircraft it usually contains an engine, as well. 
	The fuselage also serves to position control and stabilization surfaces in specific relationships to lifting surfaces, which is required for aircraft stability and maneuverability.
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="gpws">Ground Proximity Warning System</dt>

	<dt id="ils">Instrument Landing System</dt>
	<dd>
	<b>Instrument Landing System</b> (ILS) is a radionavigation system which provides <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> with horizontal and vertical guidance just before and during <a href="#landing">landing</a> and, at certain fixed points, indicates the distance to the reference point of landing.

	<dt id="lift">Lift</dt>
	<dd>
	A fluid flowing past the surface of a body exerts a force on it. 
	<b>Lift</b> is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction. 
	It contrasts with the <a href="#drag">drag</a> force, which is the component of the force parallel to the flow direction. 
	Lift conventionally acts in an upward direction in order to counter the force of gravity, but it can act in any direction at right angles to the flow.
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="nose">Nose</dt>

	The <b>nose</b> is the forwardmost section of an <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a>. 
	The nose is shaped to offer minimum aerodynamic <a href="#drag">drag</a>. 
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="overspeed">Overspeed</dt>
	<dd>
	<b>Overspeed</b> is a condition in which an engine is allowed or forced to turn beyond its design limit. 
	The consequences of running an engine too fast vary by engine type and model and depend upon several factors, chief amongst them the duration of the overspeed and by the speed attained. 
	With some engines even a momentary overspeed can result in greatly reduced engine life or even catastrophic failure. 
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="pfactor">P-Factor</dt>
	<dd class="also">asymmetric blade effect, asymmetric disc effect</dd>
	<dd>
	<b>P-factor</b> is an aerodynamic phenomenon experienced by a moving <a href="#propeller">propeller</a>, that is responsible for the asymmetrical relocation of the propeller's center of thrust when an <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> is at a high angle of attack. 
	This shift in the location of the center of thrust exerts a <a href="#yaw">yawing</a> moment on the aircraft, causing it to yaw slightly to one side. 
	A rudder input is required to counteract the yawing tendency.
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="phugoid">Phugoid</dt>
	<dd class="also">fugoid</dd>
	<dd>
	A <b>phugoid</b> is an <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> motion in which the vehicle <a href="#pitch">pitches</a> up and <a href="#climb">climbs</a>, and then pitches down and <a href="#descent">descends</a>, 
	accompanied by speeding up and slowing down as it goes "downhill" and "uphill". 
	This is one of the basic flight dynamics modes of an aircraft (others include short period, <a href="#dutchroll">dutch roll</a>, and spiral divergence), and a classic example of a negative feedback system.
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="pitch">Pitch</dt>
	<dd>
	The <b>pitch</b> axis has its origin at the center of gravity and is directed to the right, parallel to a line drawn from <a href="#wingtip">wingtip</a> to wingtip. 
	Motion about this axis is called pitch. 
	A positive pitching motion raises the <a href="#nose">nose</a> of the <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> and lowers the <a href="#tail">tail</a>. 
	The <a href="#elevators">elevators</a> are the primary control of pitch.

	<dt id="papi">Precision Approach Path Indicator</dt>
	<dd>
	A <b>precision approach path indicator</b> (PAPI) is a visual aid that provides guidance information to help a pilot acquire and maintain the correct approach to an <a href="#airdrome">airdrome</a>. 
	It is generally located beside the <a href="#ruwnay">runway</a> approximately 300 meters beyond the <a href="#landing">landing</a> threshold of the runway. 
	To use the guidance information provided by the aid to follow the correct glideslope, a pilot would manoeuvre the <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> to obtain an equal number of red and white lights.
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="propeller">Propeller</dt>
	<dd class="also">airscrew</dd>
	<dd>
	An <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> <b>propeller</b> converts rotary motion from an engine or other mechanical power source to provide propulsive force.

	</dd>
	
	<dt id="roll">Roll</dt>
	<dd>
	The <b>roll</b> axis has its origin at the center of gravity and is directed forward, parallel to the <a href="#fuselage">fuselage</a> reference line. 
	Motion about this axis is called roll. 
	An angular displacement about this axis is called bank. 
	A positive rolling motion lifts the left <a href="#wing">wing</a> and lowers the right wing. 
	The pilot rolls by increasing the <a href="#lift">lift</a> on one wing and decreasing it on the other. 
	This changes the bank angle. 
	The <a href="#aileron">ailerons</a> are the primary control of bank. 
	The <a href="#rudder">rudder</a> also has a secondary effect on bank.
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="rudder">Rudder</dt>
	<dd>
	A <b>rudder</b> is a primary control surface used to steer an <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> through air. 
	The rudder is used primarily to counter adverse <a href="#yaw">yaw</a> and <a href="#pfactor">p-factor</a> and is not the primary control used to turn the airplane. 
	A rudder operates by redirecting the air past the fuselage, thus imparting a turning or yawing motion to the aircraft. 
	In basic form, a rudder is a flat plane or sheet of material attached with hinges to the aircraft's <a href="#tail">tail</a>. 
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="runway">Runway</dt>
	<dd>
	A <b>runway</b> is a defined rectangular area on a land <a href="#airdrome">airdrome</a> prepared for the <a href="#takeoff">takeoff</a> and <a href="#landing">landing</a> of <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a>. 
	Runways may be a man-made surface (often asphalt, concrete, or a mixture of both) or a natural surface (grass, dirt, gravel, ice, or salt).
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="splits">Split S</dt>
	<dd>
	The <b>Split S</b> is an air combat maneuver mostly used to disengage from combat. 
	To execute a Split S, the pilot half-<a href="#roll">rolls</a> their <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> inverted and executes a descending half-<a href="#pitch">loop</a>, resulting in level flight in the exact opposite direction at a lower altitude.
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="tail">Tail</dt>
	<dd class="also">empennage, tail assembly</dd>
	<dd>
	The <b>tail</b> is a structure at the rear of an <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> that provides stability during flight, in a way similar to the feathers on an arrow. 
	Most aircraft feature a tail incorporating vertical and horizontal stabilizing surfaces which stabilize the flight dynamics of <a href="#yaw">yaw</a> and <a href="#pitch">pitch</a>, as well as housing control surfaces.
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="tailplane">Tailplane</dt>
	<dd class="also">horizontal stabilizer</dd>

	A <b>tailplane</b> is a small lifting surface located on the <a href="#tail">tail</a> behind the main lifting surfaces of a <a href="#fixedwing">fixed-wing</a> <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> as well as other non-fixed-wing aircraft such as <a href="#helicopter">helicopters</a> and <a href="#gyroplane">gyroplanes</a>. 
	Not all fixed-wing aircraft have tailplanes. 
	The function of the tailplane is to provide stability and control. 
	In particular, the tailplane helps adjust for changes in position of the center of pressure or center of gravity caused by changes in speed and attitude, fuel consumption, or dropping cargo or payload.
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="takeoff">Takeoff</dt>
	<dd>
	<b>Takeoff</b> is the phase of flight in which an <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> goes from the ground to flying in the air. 
	For aircraft that take off horizontally, this usually involves starting with a transition from moving along the ground on a <a href="#runway">runway</a>. 
	</dd>
	
	<dt id="taxi">Taxiing</dt>
	<dd>
	<b>Taxiing</b> is the movement of an <a href="#aircraft">aircraft</a> on the ground, under its own power, in contrast to towing or push-back where the aircraft is moved by a tug.
