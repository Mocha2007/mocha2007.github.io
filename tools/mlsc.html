	<h2><a href="#mlsc_explanation">^</a>Explanation</h2>
	<h3 id="mlsc_e_months"><a href="#mlsc_e_months">^</a>Months</h3>
	<p>
		A <em>month</em> approximates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#Synodic_month">the moon's synodic orbital period</a>.
		A <em>common month</em> comprises 30 days (if it is odd-indexed),
		or 29 days (if it is even-indexed).
		Every so often, a <em>leap month</em> is inserted, which may have 30 or 31 days.
		There are twelve months in a <em>common year</em>,
		and thirteen in a <em>leap year</em>.
		The average length of a month across a whole cycle is &ap;29.5306 days.
	</p>
	<h3 id="mlsc_e_leap"><a href="#mlsc_e_leap">^</a>Leap Month Rules</h3>
	<p>
		If the cycle number (which is the year number mod 334, explained later)
		mod 19 mod 3 is 0<abbr title="Believe it or not, this is the unique way to get 376 leap years in a cycle with as few modulus operations as possible. Unfortunately, that leaves 6 double leap years, but nothing can really be done about that. This '376' in turn was chosen to minimize the difference in number of long and short leap years, thereby minimizing drift of the new moon from the start of months.">*</abbr>, then the year is a <em>leap year</em>.
		Otherwise, it is a common year.
	</p>
	<p>
		The leap month is inserted at the end of a leap year.
		The number of leap months passed in the current cycle is recorded.
		If this number mod 19 is even, then the leap month has 31 days,
		otherwise if it is odd, it has 30 days.
	</p>
	<h3 id="mlsc_e_s1"><a href="#mlsc_e_s1">^</a>Summary so far</h3>
	<p>
		A year may contain 12 or 13 months,
		and total 354, 384, or 385 days.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <em>year</em> approximates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year">Earth's tropical orbital period</a>.
		A MLSC year is approximately &ap;365.2419 days long, on average.
	</p>
	<h3 id="mlsc_e_cycles"><a href="#mlsc_e_cycles">^</a>Cycles, Ages, and Precessions</h3>
	<p>
		A <em>cycle</em> comprises 1021 years.
		The length of the cycle was chosen because the number of lunar synodic months in 1021 tropical years
		is <em>quite nearly</em> a whole number, simplifying calculations.
		A <em>precession</em> comprises 25 cycles (and is thus 25,525 MLSC years or about 25,524 Julian years).
		The current cycle in the precession determines the <em>age</em>.
		A precession approximates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession">Earth's axial precession</a>,
		and thus what constellation the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox">vernal equinox</a> lies in.
		Ages range from 1-3 cycles as described below:

		The age determines the name of the starting month.
		It's cosmetic, and does not affect any ordinal numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Precessions start with <em>Aries</em> and proceed backwards around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac">zodiac</a>.
		The current <em>Age of Pisces</em> began <time datetime="-361-03-22">March 22, 362 BCE</time>,
		and will end <time datetime="2702-03-21">March 21, 2702 CE</time>.
	</p>
	<h3 id="mlsc_e_gals"><a href="#mlsc_e_gals">^</a>Gals</h3>
	<p>
		The largest division of time is the <em>gal</em>.
		A gal is 8,800 precessions (and is thus 224,620,000 MLSC years or about 224,615,031 Julian years).
		A gal approximates the time taken for the sun to orbit the milky way once
		(the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_year">galactic year</a>).
		The current precession's beginning of the age of Aries defines the start of <em>gal 0</em>.
		The solar system therefore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System">formed</a> in <em>gal -20</em>,
		and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">the universe</a> in <em>gal -61</em>.

	<h3 id="mlsc_e_epoch"><a href="#mlsc_e_epoch">^</a>Epoch</h3>
	<p>
		The <em>epoch</em>, or fixed, defined point in time for the calendar,
		is <time datetime="1681-03-20">March 20, 1681</time>,
		defined as being the start of the third cycle of the age of Pisces, first precession in the 61st gal.
	</p>
	<p>
		This was chosen due to being the closest alignment of a new moon with the vernal equinox since 1583.
		At an error of just 62 minutes, no better alignment will occur in the 21st century.
		As an added bonus, the vernal equinox on this year occurs only 17 seconds after midnight UTC.

	<p>
		The following information is not necessary to understand the calendar,
		but instead gives enhanced vocabulary to describe it.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <em>kalends</em> are the first day of the month (roughly a new moon).
		The <em>nones</em> are the eighth day of the month (roughly a first quarter moon).
		The <em>ides</em> are the sixteenth day of the month (roughly a full moon).
		The <em>icas</em> is the twenty-third day of the month (roughly a third quarter moon).
		The terms <em>kalends</em>, <em>nones</em>, and <em>ides</em> are pluralia tantum,
		but <em>icas</em> is a normal countable noun.
	</p>
	<p>
		The days following one of these dates are given the following names:

		&dagger; - If the month has 31 days (ie., it is a long leap month), the 23rd instead belongs to the week of the Ides,
		and the rest of the days are pushed down one (so the month's week schedule is 7-8-8-8).
		<!-- eg. main(new Date(2028, 2, 1)); -->
	</p>
	<p>
		These could be treated as weekdays, if one wished.
		The length of a "week" would then be 7 or 8 days: typically of the pattern 7-8-7-7 or 7-8-7-8, but rarely 7-8-8-8.
	</p>
	<p>
		Convenient side effects of this calendar include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Easter is almost always between the 16th and 23rd of Pisces.</li>
		<li>Ramadan (and all other islamic months, for that matter) usually begin on the first day of a month, off by no more than one day.</li>
		<li><em>More accurate</em> average year length than the Gregorian calendar, in addition to an aligned lunar cycle.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 id="mlsc_e_watch"><a href="#mlsc_e_watch">^</a>Watches</h3>
	<p>
		A <em>watch</em> is a period of two hours, centered on even hours during the day.
		The names of watches are the same as the month names, and are in the same order.
		However, the starting watch of the day is dependent on the age and month.
	</p>
	<p>
		The concept of a watch is based on what zodiacal constellation (approximately) appears in the east at a given time.
		Because of this, the starting watch is defined such that the third watch (ie., the one from 5 AM to 7 AM)
		of the first month of the year (ie., the one typically the vernal equinox)
		is the <strong>same</strong> as the current age.
		For example, in the month of Pisces during the age of Pisces, the third watch is <strong>Pisces&rsquo; watch</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Therefore, the <strong>first watch</strong> (ie., the one from 1 AM to 3 AM) is equivalent to <code>month + watch - age</code>
		(possibly offset by some constant, depending on how you define the start of the zodiacal cycle).
		For example, in the month of Ophiuchus during the age of Pisces, the ninth watch (5 PM to 7 PM) is <strong>Taurus&rsquo;s watch</strong>.
