<p>
	The Russia claim is annoying and difficult to debunk, mainly because most of the claims are nebulous, vacuous, and generic, and thus unprovable but also un-disprovable. 
	Nevertheless, there are several telltale signs that this is just, as they say, <i>fake news</i>. 
	If I've missed any accusations or evidence, please inform me. 
	To my knowledge, these are all the accusations. 
</p>
<h2 id="Leaks">The Russians Leaked the DNC/Clinton/Etc. Emails</h2>
<h3>All over the carpeting, too!</h3>
<p>
	...and this helped Hillary, right, because she didn't do anything illeg-ooooohhhhhh.....
</p>
<p>
	Gee, if only there were a way to, I don't know, <i>not do illegal things and not be found out</i>. 
	Those pesky citizens wanting their "laws" to apply to us politicians, right?  
</p>
<p>
	I mean, if this accusation is even true (still waiting on that evidence!), we should be <i>thanking</i> the Russian government! 
	So, thank you, Russia, thank you. 
</p>
<h2 id="Fake_News">The Russians printed fake news articles!</h2>
<h3>And they would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling Comeys!</h3>
<p>
	...and so does CNN<sup><a href="#2">2</a> <a href="#7">7</a> <a href="#8">8</a> <a href="#9">9</a></sup>, etc. <!--Working on finding all the links I saved - trust me, plenty more where that came from.-->
	If you don't like it, maybe learn to check your sources twice and teach others to do the same? 
	This issue is <i>definitely</i> not isolated to Russia, this is an extremely pervasive problem even in American journalism. 
</p>
<h2 id="Claims">Claims with zero evidence</h2>
<h3>Always the best type of claim</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Russia changed voter registration
		<ul>
			<li>
				The FBI found that no information was changed<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>, but that about 200,000 records were stolen.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> 
				To me this is more indicative of generic hackers who sell information to shady advertisers/identity thieves. 
				Whether they are part of the Russian government or not is irrelevant because no information was actually <i>changed</i>, and thus the election could not possibly have been affected.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Trump colludes with Russia
		<ul>
			<li>
				The only verifiable claim I've seen is that Trump made a positive comment about Putin. 
				There are a few other claims of things he's said but reading the actual quote makes it pretty clear it's being taken out of context. 
				Does making a positive comment about anyone make you a puppet, or does that only apply to Trump and Putin? 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Wikileaks is linked to Russia
		<ul>
			<li>
				I find it comical how lazy this claim is. 
				Were they Russian before the election? 
				Why suddenly after the election did they become Russian? 
				Isn't that a little... convenient? 
				(I analyze this slightly more below) 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Evidence">Evidence Indicative to me that this is "Fake News"</h2>
<h3>The Before-and-After Photos</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		News organizations constantly complained Trump was questioning legitimacy of the election<sup><a href="#6">6</a> <a href="#17">17</a> <a href="#18">18</a> <a href="#19">19</a> <a href="#21">21</a></sup>, 
		until <i>after</i> the election, when they suddenly do so themselves when the election doesn't go their way.<sup><a href="#5">5</a> <a href="#20">20</a> <a href="#22">22</a></sup></li>
	<li>Wikileaks was never accused of being Russian<sup><a href="#10">10</a> <a href="#12">12</a></sup> until <i>after</i> they revealed the emails.<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup></li>
	<li>The FBI never claimed Russia influenced the election<sup><a href="#13">13</a> <a href="#15">15</a></sup> until <i>after</i> Trump won.<sup><a href="#14">14</a> <a href="#16">16</a></sup></li>
	<li>The sheer lack of evidence supporting any connections between Wikileaks, Trump, etc. and Russia.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>
	Note the sheer preponderance of before/after stories. 
	Why is this the case? 
	I wonder if it has to do with Trump not having been thought to be able to win until he actually won. 
	Surely though, that is just a coincidence. 
</p>

<h2 id="Commentary">Some Final Commentary</h2>
<h3>Or, "Why would the news make this up though?"</h3>
<p>
	Much of this honestly reeks to me of technologically-illiterate gullible morons spreading fake news. 
	You see a lot of Russia "hacking" the election, or emails being "stolen". 
	This is indicative of a pathetic lack of knowledge on even the basics of how computers function. 
	Anyone who knows <i>half a cent</i> about computers laughs at these awkward claims - and the media wonders why we laugh. 
	The media, normies, &amp;c turned the internet against them, and now they pay the price with a Trump presidency. 
	Hope your willful ignorance was worth it!
</p>
<p>
	To be clear - we are laughing at you because you're trying to sound professional and knowledgable on technology-related topics but fail miserably and instead sound like tech-illiterate normie morons. 
</p>
<p>
	And no, knowing how to play Farmville and how to use Microsoft Word doesn't make you 'technologically literate'. 
	FGS, <a href="http://www.learnpython.org/">learn the basics of a programming language</a>, lurk <a href="https://boards.4chan.org/pol/">4chan</a>, or hell, even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/">non-defaults</a> Reddit for like <i>two fucking seconds</i>, or play a <i><a href="http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/347103-cuphead-reignites-game-journalists-good-games-debate">real</a></i> video game - you know damn well what I mean. 
	(tfw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC4F6ctEO4g">five-year-old</a> is better at video games than your journalists) 
	Hell, I even give recommendations <a href="recommend.html">here</a>! 
</p>
<p>
	This used to be a problem limited to tech/video game journalism, but sadly it seems technological illiteracy is <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20090830.gif">pervasive</a> in all corners of the media. 
	It's amazing how lazy people are, and how little they care to do even basic research on these topics, especially such a ubiquitous technology as computers!
