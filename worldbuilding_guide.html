<p>
	This guide takes a more "mathematical" and "rigorous" approach, for those who care enough about the math behind it all.
</p>

	This guide is specifically directed towards habitable worlds, but the same concepts apply to any world.
</p>

<h2 id="Star">Star</h2>
<p>
	Unless you want a dead, dark rock for a planet, you're gonna need a star.
</p>
<h3 id="Brown_Dwarf">Brown Dwarf</h3>
<p>
	Since we want to make a habitable world, we need a star <i>at least</i> as hot as the Earth.
	Otherwise, how is the planet supposed to get hotter than the star?
	Thankfully, even brown dwarfs can generate this kind of relatively low heat.
	The only other feature we'll have to look out for is the roche limit.
	Even if our star generates enough heat, the planet'll get torn to shreds if we place it too close.
	So, for our rough "bare minimum" mass, the temperature <i>at</i> the roche limit has to be at least that of Earth.
	At this point, we just set the roche and heat equations equal to each other...
</p>
$$a = R_M \sqrt[3]{2 \frac {\rho_M} {\rho_m}}$$
$$T_{eq} = T_{star} \sqrt{\frac {R_M}{2a}} \sqrt[4]{1-A}$$
<p>
	Unfortunately, since the heat equation is solved for \({ T }_{ eq }\), we need to solve for \(a\):
</p>
$$a = \frac {T_{star}^2 R_M}{2T_{eq}^2} \sqrt { 1-A }$$
<p>
	Now we're in business.
</p>
$$R_M \sqrt[3]{2 \frac {\rho_M} {\rho_m}} = \frac {T_{star}^2 R_M}{2T_{eq}^2} \sqrt { 1-A }$$
<p>
	We can cancel out the star's radii for starters:
</p>
$$ \sqrt[3]{2 \frac {\rho_M} {\rho_m}} = \frac {T_{star}^2}{2T_{eq}^2} \sqrt { 1-A }$$
<p>
	It might look like we can't cancel out anything else, but actually, we <i>can</i>.
	Since we're finding the bare minimum, we can assume the planetary albedo is zero, since that's as efficient a planet can get at absorbing light.
</p>
$$ \sqrt[3]{2 \frac {\rho_M} {\rho_m}} = \frac {T_{star}^2}{2T_{eq}^2}$$
<p>
	There's a very handy rule of thumb when it comes to stellar temperatures, and it ends up being rather accurate:
</p>
$$ T_{star} = T_\odot \sqrt{\frac {M_{star}} {M_\odot}}$$
<p>
	This alone won't help us though.
	We'll also need a formula to get density.
	Thankfully, there's also <i>another</i> helpful approximation!
</p>
$$ R_{star} = R_\odot \frac {M_{star}} {M_\odot}$$
<p>
	Let's plug this into the density equation:
</p>
$$ \rho = \frac {m} {\frac {4} {3} \pi r^3}$$
$$ \rho_{star} = \frac {M_{star}} {\frac {4} {3} \pi \left( R_\odot \frac {M_{star}} {M_\odot} \right) ^3}$$
$$ \rho_{star} = \frac {3 M_\odot^3} {4 \pi R_\odot^3 M_{star}^2}$$
<p>
	Let's chuck it all back into the big equation, simplify, and isolate \(M_M\):
</p>
$$ \sqrt[3]{2 \frac {\frac {3 M_\odot^3} {4 \pi R_\odot^3 M_M^2}} {\rho_m}} = \frac {T_\odot^2 \frac {M_M} {M_\odot}}{2T_{eq}^2}$$
$$ \frac {12 M_\odot^5} {\pi R_\odot^3 \rho_m} = \frac {T_\odot^6 M_M^4}{T_{eq}^6}$$
$$ M_M^4 = \frac {12 M_\odot^5 T_{eq}^6} {\pi R_\odot^3 \rho_m T_\odot^6}$$
<p>
	This is great!
	Don't let all the symbols fool you, the only unknowns at this point are \(\rho_m\) and \(M_M\).
	The equilibrium temperature is going to be Earth's (~255K).
	Since it's clear that higher densities will allow for a smaller minimum, we can assume the density is equivalent to the densest planet in the solar system - Earth!
	Now, we just have to plug this formula into a calculator!
</p>
$$ M_M = \sqrt[4] {\frac {12 M_\odot^5 T_{eq\oplus}^6} {\pi R_\odot^3 \rho_\oplus T_\odot^6}}$$
$$ M_M = 2.523 \cdot 10^{28} \mathrm{kg} = 13.29M_J$$
<p>
	So it seems all but the smallest brown dwarfs can safely hold a planet with similar temperature to Earth.
	In practice though, our planet's gonna have albedo.
	With an earthlike albedo, this actually becomes:
</p>
$$ M_M = 5.009 \cdot 10^{28} \mathrm{kg} = 26.39M_J$$
<p>
	And if our planet didsn't have a greenhouse effect, that would increase even more to:
</p>
$$ M_M = 6.249 \cdot 10^{28} \mathrm{kg} = 32.92M_J$$
<p>
	As long as we're above these values, we're safe, at least in terms of temperature.
	A problem with this brown dwarf world arises when you calculate the peak emission wavelength:
	(via Wien's displacement law, \(b\) is a constant which has <a href='https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?bwien'>a page on NIST</a> detailing its value)
</p>
$$ \lambda = \frac {b} {T}$$
$$ \lambda = 3.254 \mathrm{\mu m}$$
<p>
	This is in the infrared range, and so our brown dwarf would appear very dim to our eyes, as the upper limit of human vision is about \(740 \mathrm{nm}\).
	Perhaps though, this world has evolved critters with IR vision - who knows!
	There are other hypothetical issues with brown dwarfs, including tidal locking, but nothing explicitly procluding the appearance of life.
</p>

<h3 id="Red_Dwarf">Red/Orange Dwarf</h3>
<p>
	Red dwarfs are the most common type of main sequence star in the universe, acounting for three-quarters of all main sequence stars.
	Only one potential issue exists: tidal locking.
	Life can certainly exist on a tidally locked world, but it may be very difficult.
	The timeframe for tidal locking to occur is roughly:
</p>
$$ t_{lock} \approx \frac {a^6 r} {mM^2} \cdot 5\cdot10^{28} \mathrm{\frac {kg^3 s} {m^7}}$$
<p>
	For an earthlike world, this simplifies to:
</p>
$$ t_{lock} \approx \frac {a^6} {M^2} \cdot 5\cdot10^{10} \mathrm{\frac {kg^2 s} {m^6}}$$
<p>
	If we want enough time for life to evolve, we're gonna need \(t_{lock}\) to equal the age of the earth:
</p>
$$ 1.43\cdot10^{17} \mathrm{s} \approx \frac {a^6} {M^2} \cdot 5\cdot10^{10} \mathrm{\frac {kg^2 s} {m^6}}$$
$$ a^6 \approx M^2 \cdot 2.69\cdot10^{6} \mathrm{\frac {m^6} {kg^2}}$$
$$ a \approx 11.8 \sqrt[3]{M} \mathrm{\frac {m} {kg^{\frac{1}{3}}}}$$
<p>
	For the smallest red dwarfs \(M=0.08M_\odot\), this distance is about \(a=0.427\mathrm{au}\).
	However, given the star property approximations mentioned in the last section, a planet orbiting at this distance would have a temperature of just \(T_{eq}=29\mathrm{K}\).
	So clearly, if we care about tidal locking, we're gonna have to figure out the minimum mass which allows a world to exist safely.
	Again, since this is a minimum, we can assume albedo is optimal:
</p>
$$ 11.8 \sqrt[3]{M} \mathrm{\frac {m} {kg^{\frac{1}{3}}}} = \frac {T_{star}^2 R}{2T_{eq}^2}$$
<p>
	Using the approximation for \(R\) and \(T_{star}\), and simplifying:
</p>
$$ 11.8 \sqrt[3]{M} \mathrm{\frac {m} {kg^{\frac{1}{3}}}} = \frac {T_\odot^2 R_\odot M^2}{2T_{eq}^2 M_\odot^2}$$
$$ 23.6 \mathrm{\frac {m} {kg^{\frac{1}{3}}}} = \frac {T_\odot^2 R_\odot M^{\frac{5}{3}}}{T_{eq}^2 M_\odot^2}$$
<p>
	Isolate M, and solve:
</p>
$$ M^{\frac{5}{3}} = \frac {T_{eq}^2 M_\odot^2}{T_\odot^2 R_\odot } \cdot 23.6 \mathrm{\frac {m} {kg^{\frac{1}{3}}}}$$
$$ M = 1.779 \cdot 10^{30} \mathrm{kg} = 0.8948M_\odot$$
<p>
	A star of this mass would be of type G7V.
	But wait, don't put your red and orange dwarfs down yet!
	If our world is a moon orbiting a gas giant, none of this even matters!
	And if you don't care about tidal locking, or have a shorter timeframe, you can also ignore this.
</p>

<h3 id="Yellow_Dwarf">Yellow Dwarf</h3>
<p>
	Having a yellow dwarf is definitely the most conservative way to go.
	After all, if we sprung from a rock orbiting one yellow dwarf, surely there must be others!
	Indeed, that is the case.
	You	don't need to worry about anything with this class, so let's move on to the next.
</p>

<h3 id="Big_Bois">Big Bois</h3>
<p>
	Now we get into the big stars.
	The big issue here is, again, the timeframe.
	But this time, instead of worrying about tidal locking, we have to worry about the lifespan of the star.
	A good approximation for lifespan is given by:
</p>
$$ t_{star} = t_\odot \sqrt{\frac {M_\odot^5}{M_{star}^5}}$$
<p>
	Since we want the lifespan to be at least the age of the Earth, we just have to rearrange this equation and solve:
</p>
$$ M_{star} = M_\odot \sqrt[5] {\frac {t_\odot^2}{t_{\oplus}^2}}$$
$$ M_{star} = 2.727 \cdot 10^{30} \mathrm{kg} = 1.371M_\odot$$
<p>
	You can see how much impact adding just a little mass makes.
	In fact, if we were to just throw Jupiter into the sun, it'd reduce the sun's lifespan by almost twenty-three million years!
	The earliest known life appeared on earth about 4.28 Bya, which means simple life could arise in just 260 million years.
	If we plug this value in instead, we get this:
</p>
$$ M_{star} = 8.561 \cdot 10^{30} \mathrm{kg} = 4.305M_\odot$$
<p>
	Consider the first value to be the most conservative upper limit, and the second value to be the most liberal upper limit.
	A star of the former mass would be of type F4V and the latter mass would be of type B7V.
</p>
