<h2 id="Purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>
	Many a time have I had to repeat or reformulate an explanation given about a certain topic.
	This manual ensures I have a centralized location to store all the explanations I give about various English topics.
	I hope this will help your study of English as much as it has helped others.
</p>
<h2 id="Formality">Formality</h2>
<p>
	There are many words and constructions that can make a sentence sound formal or informal.
	These are noted in their respective sections.
	This section, however, will focus on the importance of using the appropriate formality for the situation.
</p>
<p>
	If you use <i>too high</i> a formality, people may think you're being sarcastic, insincere, or dismissive.
	This may come as a surprise to some learners, but many natives will switch to an excessively formal register in order to sound this way.
	Conversely, if you use <i>too low</i> a formality, people may think you're being dismissive, or don't care about what the other speaker has to say.
</p>
<h2 id="Questions">Questions</h2>
<p>
	For questions, you move the auxiliary verb to the front of the sentence.
	If there is a wh-word, you also move that word in front of the verb.
	This is called <i>inversion</i>.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>I do run. &rarr; <span class="tintgreen">Do I run?</span></li>
	<li>You can see it. &rarr; <span class="tintgreen">Can you see it?</span></li>
	<li><abbr title="This form is actually grammatical, but only used as an exclamation of surprise.">I can do what.</abbr> &rarr; <span class="tintgreen">What can I do?</span></li>
	<li>I have always driven a car before yesterday. &rarr; <span class="tintgreen">Have I always driven a car before yesterday?</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Questions_without_Auxiliaries">Questions without Auxiliaries</h3>
<p>
	If the original sentence uses <i>do</i> as an auxiliary,
	or doesn't use an auxiliary and uses a verb in the simple present,
	you need to use <i>do</i>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>I run. &rarr; <span class="tintgreen">Do I run?</span></li>
	<li>You see it. &rarr; <span class="tintgreen">Do you see it?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>
	Likewise, if the original sentence uses <i>did</i> as an auxiliary,
	or doesn't use an auxiliary and uses a verb in the simple past,
	you need to use <i>did</i>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>I ran. &rarr; <span class="tintgreen">Did I run?</span></li>
	<li>You saw it. &rarr; <span class="tintgreen">Did you see it?</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Preposition_Stranding">Preposition Stranding</h3>
<p>
	For more complex wh-phrases, two forms are possible:
</p>
<ul>
	<li class="tintgreen"><b>What</b> did you cook the meal <b>with</b>?</li>
	<li class="tintgreen"><b>With what</b> did you cook the meal?</li>
</ul>
<p>
	However, the latter form is seen as exceptionally <a href="Formality">formal</a>, even archaic,
	and is inappropriate in all but the most formal writing.
</p>
<h3 id="Bad_Questions">Bad Questions</h3>
<p>
	The following are examples of questions which break <a href="Questions">the guidelines set above</a>, and are thus incorrect:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>I ran. &rarr; <span class="tintred">*Did I ran?</span></li>
	<li>You can see it. &rarr; <span class="tintred">*Do you can see it?</span></li>
	<li>You are going where. &rarr; <span class="tintred">*You are going where?</span></li>
	<li>You are going where. &rarr; <span class="tintred">*Are you going where?</span></li>
	<li>You are going where. &rarr; <span class="tintred">*Where you are going?</span></li>
	<li>You are going where. &rarr; <span class="tintred">*Where do you are going?</span></li>
	<li>You are going where. &rarr; <span class="tintred">*Where do you be going?</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Future">The Future</h2>
<p>
	Many learners are taught the future is always expressed with <i>will</i>.
	This is false beyond false.
	Using <i>will</i> to express the future is actually less common than the simple present or present continuous.
</p>
<p>
	Compound future tenses are even rarer.
	For every verb in the simple future, there are forty in the simple present.
	For every verb in the future perfect, there are a hundred in the present perfect.
	For every verb in the future perfect continuous, there are <i>five hundred</i> in the present perfect continuous.
	Now granted, not every verb in the simple present is a future action,
	but it illustrates the sheer rarity of using the future in compound tenses.

</p>
<p>
	Consider the following sentences, which all sound better in the present:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>I hope he <span class="tintgreen">gets</span> better. (versus the ungrammatical) *I hope he <span class="tintred">will get</span> better.</li>
	<li>I <span class="tintgreen">go</span> to Seattle Friday. (versus the still grammatical but slightly less natural) I <span class="tintgreen">will go</span> to Seattle Friday.</li>
	<li>I <span class="tintgreen">am going</span> to Seattle Friday. (ditto) I <span class="tintgreen">will go</span> to Seattle Friday.</li>
</ul>
