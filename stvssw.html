<p>
	A short list comparing facets of the franchises.
	This is based almost entirely on my limited knowledge of both franchises.
	Specifically, for Star Trek, TNG-era and before works, and for Star Wars, pre-Disney works.

		<td>Aliens</td>
		<td>
			Humans predominate, but three other races are common: the Klingons, Romulans, and Vulcans.
			Numerous other races exist but are generally rare.
			Virtually all sapients are humanoid, closely resembling humans, usually with minor cosmetic alteration.
			Certain races have special abilities: Betazoids have telepathic powers, and Klingons have great strength.
		</td>
		<td>
			Humans predominate, but the universe is very diverse.
			Species of all shapes and sizes can be found, but leadership positions are almost purely occupied by humans.
			The variety of alien life has generally increased with new releases.
			For example, in ANH, the only aliens shown were on Tatooine.
			In PM, however, we see a galactic senate of hundreds of alien species.

		<td>Earth, Humans, etc.</td>
		<td>
			The <span class="title">Star Trek</span> universe takes place in the centuries after the present.
			Earth exists as it does in our universe, and no alternate explanation for the origin of humans is given.
		</td>
		<td>
			There are indications that the humans in the <span class="title">Star Wars</span> universe originate from Coruscant,
			but it is never explicitly stated in any of the films or television series.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Magic</td>
		<td>
			In TOS, there are several episodes with seemingly magical objects (eg. the time portal in 1x28).
			In TNG, the Q appear to have magical powers,
			although one could explain them away as merely being technology beyong comprehension.
			Aside from them, magic is fairly rare in the TNG universe.
		</td>

			The Force is a power, with varying innate strengths, allowing various feats including:
			<ul>
				<li>Detecting the presence of other Force users (All Films)</li>
				<li>Prescience (Most Films)</li>
				<li>Suggestion (ANH, RotJ, PM, AotC)</li>
				<li>Telekinesis (All Films) of objects ranging from under a pound (AotC, fruit) to several tons (ESB, X-Wing), including the Force Choke (ANH, ESB, RotS)</li>
				<li>Telepathy (ESP, RotJ, PM)</li>
			</ul>

	<tr>
		<td>Politics</td>
		<td>
			There are three primary factions: the United Federation of Planets (often referred to as simply "the Federation"), the Klingon Empire, and the Romulan Empire.
			There are also numerous independent systems, and neutral zones on the borders between these three major factions.
			Since TNG, the Cardassians have also been a significant faction.
			The Federation is said to control over a thousand planets.
		</td>
		<td>
			The political situation varies over time, but the galaxy is typically ruled by a single entity - the Republic, or the Empire.
			Control over individual worlds decreases the further from the capital one goes.
			Large parts of the outer rim, for example, are said to be controlled by the Hutts.
			The Republic was said to control thousands of systems.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Time</td>
		<td>
			TOS takes place in the mid-23rd century.
			TNG takes place in the mid-24th century.
		</td>
		<td>
			<span class="title">Star Wars</span> takes place "a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away".
			No more specific description is given.
			Time in-universe is generally described relative to the battle of Yavin (years BBY or ABY).
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Timescale</td>
		<td>
			The bulk of the films and television series takes place from the 22nd through 24th centuries - a period of about three centuries.
			Some television episodes take place in Earth's past or present.
			For example, most of TOS 1x28 takes place in 1930,
			and <span class="title">Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</span> takes place in 1986 (the film's year of release).
			A few episodes even delve into the universe's future (eg. TNG 7x25) but generally not by further than a few decades.
			Sometimes, alternate timelines are created or visited (eg. TNG 7x11), but these generally resolve into the original timeline.
		</td>
		<td>
			The nine films in the main series cover a period of 67 years.
			There is a gap of 19 years after the prequel series, and a gap of 30 years before the sequel series.
			Some books go beyond this range, and some events are said to take place thousands of years before present.
			There is no time travel, and there are no alternate universes.
