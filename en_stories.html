	Each story has a table at the top called the key.
	The key lays out several useful pieces of information.
	<b>Length</b> tells you how long each part is.
	It tells you the number of words and sentences, and also tells you how long it can take to read.
	<b>%1000</b> tells you how many words in the story are in the top 1000 most common English words.
	<b>Hardest words</b> has, in order, the three rarest English words in the story.
	If you understand all three words, the rest will probably be easy!
	You can also move your cursor over these words to see how rare they are.

<p>
	Jupiter is the fifth planet of our sun.
	It is the largest of all eight known planets.
	It is mostly made of gas, and so it is called a gas giant.
	It is brown, cold, and very pretty.
</p>
<p>
	Jupiter's most interesting feature is its large red storm, called the great red spot.
	It is a storm that has existed for hundreds of years, and is larger than even the Earth!
</p>
<p>
	Jupiter has four large moons, but many more small ones.
	The first of these moons, Io, looks very strange.
	It is white and yellow, with spots of many other colors.
	It has many geyser which send water very high up!
</p>
<p>
	Jupiter's second large moon is Europa.
	It is a ball of ice, with many cuts along its surface.
	Many scientists think it may have a sea under its surface!
</p>
<p>
	Jupiter's third large moon is Ganymede.
	It is a large grey ball of rock larger than even Mercury!
</p>
<p>
	Jupiter's last large moon is Callisto.
	It is another strange looking moon.
	It looks like a black ball with many white points.
</p>
<p>
	Right now, Jupiter is being studied by NASA's Juno probe.
	The probe studies Jupiter's clouds up close.
	Many pretty pictures have come from Juno!
</p>
<p>
	Maybe one day we will be able to visit our largest planet, Jupiter!
