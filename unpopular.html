	I've moved these from the about page since they were hogging up a lot of real estate. 
	Enjoy. 
</p>

<h2 id="Casual">Casual/Non-Serious</h2>
<p>
	I don't really make much of an attempt at an argument in these few, I just keep the point short. 
	In this section I will rarely cite sources unless they are further than a simple google search away. 
	You have been warned! 
</p>

<h3 id="2016 Results">The results of the 2016 election were unsurprising.</h3>

<p>
	I'm not going to argue from a platform or political perspective, but a statistical one. 
	All of the polling data showed that the election was close - nearly as close as the 2000 election. 
	There were <i>numerous</i> known routes where Trump could win - eg. "secret trump voters", the so-called "blue wall", speaking of which...
</p>

<h3 id="Blue Wall">The blue wall was always unstable.</h3>

<p>
	Based on polling data from before the election, each blue wall state was the equivalent of rolling one six-sided die... and hoping to not roll a one or two. 
	Now, granted, <i>most</i> of the dice won't be ones... but it'd be more surprising if one or two <i>didn't</i> flip. 
	Keep in mind, the blue wall consisted of up to seven states (depending on who you ask), so we would expect two or three to flip on average (in the actual election, five did). 
	Statistically speaking, the results of the election were <i>higher</i> than the average, but not obscenely so. 
</p>

<h3 id="No_Free_Ticket">Dems do <i>not</i> have a free ticket to the 2020 Presidency.</h3>

<p>
	The 2020 election will unfold in one of two ways. Either A, 
	they try again for a repeat of the election, run a Clinton-esque candidate, and fail <i>again</i>, even to Trump, or B, 
	they take a step back and realize the only way forward is to run a progressive candidate, &agrave; la Sanders. 
	The Democratic party had the election in the <i>bag</i> and they threw it away cause they were pussyfooting around the progressive platform. 
	The next generation of voters is <i>not</i> going to vote for Clinton people anymore, and this effect will only strengthen come more elections. 
</p>

<h3 id="Don_not_Bad">The Don is neither Hitler nor Saint</h3>
<p>
	It's well known that Donald Trump is not of the <i>best</i> moral character, 
	but I feel the media has overplayed how bad of a person he is - to the point of hilarious irony and self-unawareness. 
	There is little point in my arguing this - you have made up your mind long before visiting this website. 
	You either hate him or love him. There seems to be, unfortunately for me, no middle ground. 
</p>
<p>
	I feel, ultimately, Trump will end up rememberd the opposite way of Harding - 
	initially, Harding was well-liked during his term, but after several years as more and more scandals unfolded, his memory became corrupted. 
	Trump, I feel, will be remembered the opposite: hated and plagued by scandal during his term(s), whether legitimate or "fake news", 
	but as the bigger picture becomes visible, I feel people will at least <i>soften</i> their rage. 
</p>

<h2 id="Semi-Serious">Semi-Serious</h2>

	Here I make some attempt at an argument, but I infuse it with lots of sarcasm. 
</p>

<h3 id="Freedom_of_Speech">Freedom of Speech, not "Freedom of Only Speech I Like"</h3>
<div class="sub">Or how to use Argument for Evil, or yeah, sure, Good too, I Guess</div>
<p>
	You don't have to <i>agree</i> with the left or right, but they have a right to speak their minds. 
	If you are incapable of debating them in a serious, honest discussion, then your position is baseless and weak beyond tatters. 
	Take for example, Neo-Nazis. A lot of people are saying they should be imprisoned for their views alone, 
	but if their position is as ridiculous and despicable as you claim (which, we can likely both agree, it <i>clearly</i> is), 
	then use argument to show the public how ridiculous these people are, instead of making complete <i>asses</i> and <i>dolts</i> out of yourself. 
</p>
<p>
	To be completely, no-sarcasm honest, when I hear people say people with certain positions should be banned from speaking, I read the subtext that you <i>agree</i> with their position. 
	I mean, if you can't even do something as simple as argue against a position, especially one you <i>claim</i> to oppose, 
	then I can only assume you <i>completely and fully agree</i> with said position. 
	Forget even comparing you to other <i>people</i>, this would make you even less articulate than other <i>species of animals</i>, 
	including Gorillas and Chimpanzees, which have been documented to explain their reasoning for feeling certain emotions, using sign language. 
</p>
<p>
	Don't like being subhuman? Tired of injuring yourself jumping from your chromosome count to your IQ? 
	Here, since you seem to be utterly incapable of forming any kind of rational argument, let me help you out with some:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Neo-Naziism is wrong <b>because</b> I believe in equality between all people."</li>
	<li>"Flat Earth Theory is wrong <b>because</b> if the Earth really were accelerating upwards at 1g, then we would reach the impassible speed of light in less than a year."</li>
	<li>"Rigdecai is not otp <b>because</b> unlike with Mordecai, Rigby's interactions with High-Five Ghost are universally positive."</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Now I know this requires you to use your singular, lonely brain cell, but bear with me here. 
	The pattern all of these arguments take is the <i>same</i> - "X is true/false <b>because</b> Y". 
	You state your <b>claim</b> and then support your claim with <b>reasoning</b>. 
	This is called an <b>argument</b>. Learn to use it and stop sounding like a fucking two-year old who mommy didn't buy a new toy for.
</p>
<p>
	So, in conclusion, if you ship <i>anything</i> from Regular Show, it's gotta be Rigby and High-Five Ghost. 
	For god's sake, it's like they're MADE for each other!!! 
	That is all. 
</p>

	You can take these following seriously. 
	Here I use evidence and citations to move points. 
	Be warned though, I might use the elusive <i><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmBlind">sarcasm</a></i>, so make sure not to be a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">Sheldon</a> <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfHumor">McBuzzkill</a>.

<h3 id="Antiveganism">No, "Animals have feelings too" does not make Omnivorism Immoral</h3>
<p>
	Probably the most convincing and <i>least</i> emotion-based philosophical argument for veganism I have found is some variation of the following:
</p>
<div class="sub">
	Eating meat is wrong because there is no reason to place animals under humans.<br/>They (well, many of them) have feelings and emotions too.
</div>
<p>
	So let's break this down. Basically, there are two parts to this argument: 
	that there is no reason to place animals under humans, and that animals have feelings/emotions/some other quality that is reason to avoid consuming them. 
	Now, I take no issue with the latter half - many species of animals have been demonstrated to possess the capacity for the critical thinking, feelings, and emotions that defines intelligence and sentience. 
	Thus we come back to the first half - that there is no reason to place animals under humans. 
	And this argument, that I will now present, is one I have <i>never</i> seen used, either because the research is comparatively new, nobody's thought of it, or a combination of both. 
</p>
<p>
	Now, let's think for a moment. What do vegans eat for sustenance? Well, mostly plants, often with some fungi and supplements. 
	I'm going to completely ignore the whole "veganism is expensive" argument since it's been done to death, so you had better thank me for that. 
	If you agree that animals having aforementioned characteristics is reason enough to avoid eating animals, then if I were to demonstrate <i>plants</i> were <i>also</i> capable of these abilities, you would have to agree that plants should be avoided too. 
	And as you may expect, this is exactly what I am about to demonstrate:

	<!-- todo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_arithmetic -->
</ul>
<p>
	Well then. It seems we are at an impasse. 
	In fact, there is evidence that plants may even communicate via <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6198/808">exchange of genetic material</a>, something animals are incapable of. 
	The only thing not mentioned here already is <i>emotion</i>, something notoriously difficult to define. Nevertheless, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion">Wikipedia</a> defines <i>emotion</i> as so:
</p>
<div class="sub">
	Emotion is any conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity and a high degree of pleasure or displeasure.
</div>
<p>
	Several of the aforementioned articles (particularly the ones on pain) mention that plants respond to pain (displeasure). 
	The other part of this definition is "intense mental activity". 
	Like even quite a few animals, plants do not have a "brain" in the traditional sense. 
	It seems our best understanding is that "thought" takes place throughout the plant. 
	Of course, this is just attempting to project antropocentric concepts onto nonhuman beings - which brings us full circle. 
	There is no objective way to say that how plants experience reality is inferior to animals, especially since the evidence suggests the opposite: 
	that, in many ways, plants can sense, think, and communicate in <i>more</i> ways than any animal can - including humans. 
</p>
<p>
	So next time you try to suggest animals are inherently superior to plants, just know that your ferns are probably emitting the chemical equivalent of the bird.
